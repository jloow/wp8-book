An important part of gender equality work is a situation assessment from a gender perspective, e.g. a gender analysis, meaning that facts are gathered, and that gender patterns are made visible and analyzed. Gender divided statistics is a necessary tool for gender analysis. Gender divided statistics enfolds not only statistics by sex, the statistics must aim at visualizing men and women’s conditions and needs at work and identifying problem areas. It is important to recognize both similarities and dissimilarities between men and women. A good way to start is to analyze issues of work division, task assignments, competence development, career paths to leadership positions, recruitment processes, sick leave, injuries, harassment cases, etc. – from a gender perspective. To perform an in depth gender analysis, quantitative and qualitative, with the aim of addressing norms, you need competence specializing in this field. If the groundwork is in place according to good knowledge about the organization and women and men’s condition, it is easier to introduce and implement new actions.</a></li>

A common mistake it to just formulate a general objective: increasing the number of women in the organization, gazing at numerical gender equality goals X % in policy documents. A good way to start is for example the SMART-tool. SMART goals is a tool used to formulate goals that are; <em>Specific</em> (clearly defined), <em>Measurable</em> (can be measured and followed up), <em>Accepted</em> (of all actors involved), <em>Realistic and Relevant</em> and <em>Time-limited</em> (a deadline is provided). Aim at identifying objectives in both quantitative and qualitative terms.</a></li>

To achieve the aim of improved gender equality, it is important that in the early stages think about organizational conditions and make plans on how to go about it. A good planning process is important in change management and in all gender equality initiatives as such. The project/initiative/action needs a: 1. Budget, 2. Schedule/timetable, 3. Accountability, who/m is responsible and for what. Allocating of resources (money, time, capacity) is an important steep to formalize the project and to prepare the organization for the upcoming action and change. Do not forget that change management and gender equality initiatives have costs! An important issue in the planning phase is also to determine if there is a need for expertise outside the organization. Do we need specialized competence for example process leaders or gender experts?</a></li>

To ask for results and evaluate the measures implemented is also a way to visualize that gender issues are a priority and important an important issue for the organization. Evaluation must be made of the result/outcome in relation to project specific objectives, preferably both in quantitative- and qualitative terms. But also evaluation of the process as a whole, what can we take with us to the next cycle? At last, the entire process and its content should be carefully documented in order for the work to be implemented as an organizational structure that is easy to follow, evaluate and for the work not to be dependent on specific individuals in the organization.</a></li>

Today’s mining industry is facing major technical changes. The earlier incremental development will most certainly be replaced by more radical changes based on digitization and the internet of things. These changes must be managed in a socially sustainable way so we don’t create bigger problems than we are solving. We must design tomorrow’s mining so that it can gain social acceptance. Tomorrow’s mining companies must be able to offer safe and attractive workplaces that can attract young people to the industry. In a longer perspective, this can lead to the recognition of the mining industry as an ethical, ecological and diverse industry that can offer challenging jobs and attractive workplaces. The purpose of this book is to provide advice and simple guidance for how to develop and introduce, something we call Social management of new technology.
</p>
</div>
<p>The book is shaped like a Swedish smorgasbord. This means that all chapters can be read independently. One consequence of this is that there may be some repetitions. Most chapters end with a number of summarizing practical advice.</p>
<p>The book consists of 22 chapters including this introduction. All chapters are available for computers, tablets and mobile phones on …. Någon adress här?</p>
<p>In chapter 2, The future of metal mining, we will discuss the challenges facing today's metal mining industry. We make 15 predictions about the future that should be seen as a contextual background to the discussions in the following chapters</p>
<p>In chapter 3, <em>A vision of “The New Attractive Mine”</em>, we have tried to create a vision of a future mine, considering the working environment and attractiveness all the way from the mine planning stage.</p>
<p>In chapter 4, <em>What characterizes an attractive mining work?</em>, we have used a general model which describes 22 dimensions of what characterizes an attractive work and applied it to the mining industry.</p>
<p>In chapter 5, <em>Attracting young people to the mining industry</em>, we have summarized our findings in six recommendations for creating attractive workplaces and increasing the visibility of the good parts of mining work</p>
<p>In chapter 6, <em>Meeting social challenges in established mining communities</em>, we broaden the frame of reference and discuss the mining industry's responsibility to operate in a socially sustainable society.</p>
<p>In chapter 7, <em>Risk analysis and prevention</em>, we focus on the safety aspects and present some practical models for risk assessment. We underline the role of the mine planners, they must find solutions that both promote high productivity and good economy as well as safety and a healthy work environment.</p>
<p>In chapter 8, <em>Safe and attractive workplaces for contractor personnel</em>, we address that workplace accidents is a problem in relation to outsourcing and contracting. We indicate a number points that can be taken into consideration when aiming to increase safety in these types of work settings.</p>
<p>In chapter 9, <em>Understanding, and improving, safety culture</em>, we discuss improved safety culture as a long-term and sustainable safety strategy. We suggests some considerations that mining companies can make when seeking to develop their safety culture</p>
<p>In chapter10, <em>Gender and gender equality</em>, we present a brief theoretical background on why gender is an important issue for the mining industry. The chapter ends with some general advice.</p>
<p>In chapter 11, <em>Can technology improve gender equality in mining?</em>, the myth is highlighted that new technology will automatically open the mines for women. More systematic work is required to correct the uneven gender balance</p>
<p>In chapter 12, <em>Working for gender equality in organizations</em>, we present a practical model for how to work with gender equality, a work that is necessary if mining is to be considered as a modern industry.</p>
<p>In chapter 13, <em>Lean mining</em>, we ….</p>
<p>In chapter 14, <em>Industry 4.0 in a mining context</em>, we explore the consequences that digitalization and Industry 4.0 can have on future mining work. The vast majority of mining work will be affected by these developments, but miners will not disappear, they will be different in the future.</p>
<p>In chapter15, <em>Mining 4.0 - Utopia or Dystopia</em>, we summarize our experiences in two extremes, a negative dystopian development and a positive utopian. The chapter concludes with six recommendations on how to start shaping the future of Mining 4.0 on human terms.</p>
<p><strong>In chapter16, <em>Acceptance of new technology</em>, we</strong> give a brief overview of <strong>the most prominent theories</strong> that are important for understanding which factors affect the acceptance of new technologies.</p>
<p><strong>In chapter 17, <em>Positioning technology</em>, we</strong> discuss the positive effects of positioning technology from a safety perspective and sets it against privacy concerns. Factors that need to be considered to enhance privacy and reduce the perception of misuse are discussed.</p>
<p><strong>In chapter18, <em>investing in new technology: guidelines for how to do it right - or to understand</em> what went wrong, we provide guidelines, or statements to consider, when investing in new technology. These questions are meant to aid the organization in the process towards technology that are</strong> effective, efficient and accepted from a user perspective.</p>
<p>In chapter19, <em>Adapting the technology to the miners</em>, we present a theory for human-centred design, which is a theory for designing equipment, workplaces, tasks and organisations on human terms.</p>
<p>In chapter 20, <em>Iterative design of mining workplaces</em>, we describe a circular method for mining planning that is more dynamic than today's linear planning. Furthermore, an iterative process offers more opportunities to create attractive workplaces for both new and existing employees by involving them more in the design process.</p>
<p>In chapter 21, <em>More research is needed</em>, we present a research agenda that focuses on to attract and keep skilled personnel in a future high-tech mining industry.</p>
<p>In chapter 22, <em>Checklist for safe and attractive mining workplaces</em>, we summarize our results in a practical checklist. There are many aspects, issues and questions that must be considered and addressed in order to achieve safe and attractive mining workplaces. This checklist aims to help highlight potential areas of improvement in a mining workplace that could make it a safer and more attractive workplace, without presenting in-depth solutions that may limit the decision-making process.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we will discuss the challenges facing today's metal mining industry. Our statements about the future should be seen as a contextual background to the discussions that will follow in the following chapters</p>
<p>The world's metal mining industry is rapidly changing and faces a number of challenges which must be addressed with a socio-technical approach that covers the whole mining and minerals value adding chain including environmental issues. We have tried to capture this uncertain future in fifteen predictions presented below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Future mining will be shaped in a context where it is necessary to produce at costs that are determined in <em>international competition</em>. The prices of metals and minerals are set by the market but in the long term, there is little doubt that the demand is increasing. Large nations like China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and the whole of Africa will require a larger share of consumption which is leading to the opening of new mines. The difference between these countries' annual “per capita”-consumption and Western Europe can be more than 10 times.</p></li>
<li><p>Production conditions will be characterized by the fact that the nearby and easily accessible ores will be mined first. <em>New ores will also become more distant or found in the depths</em>. Large ore reserves are located under the sea and there is hardly any doubt that the mining and off-shore companies will develop new technology to extract these. In both cases, production costs will increase.</p></li>
<li><p>Mining depths increase, and it brings new stability problems. The role of rock mechanics in the design of layouts, cutting sequences, strata stabilization, roof bolting etc. must be a central issue for the future. <em>Full face drilling and cutting</em> should be interesting from a safety perspective, both directly in safer drifting operations and also in that it can create more sthe tablegalleries due to reduced or no blasting damages. Cutting should also be useful for selective mining of high quality ore in narrow ore bodies. Production drilling and blasting for <em>controlled fragmentation</em> are two very crucial operations in the ore mining cycle. Improvements in these operations opens up many possibilities for <em>automation</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The environmental requirements</em> affect both energy consumption and management of ore tailings. The discussion of energy consumption is largely linked to global warming and carbon emissions. Today not all nations have joined the Paris Climate Agreement, but in the long term, some form of coordination surely will be established. The cost of emission allowances will be a significant factor to consider.</p></li>
<li><p>The mining industry is an <em>energy-intensive industry</em> with high CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Improvement of energy efficiency will increase the economic profitability as well as reducing environmental impact. There are many components that affect the total energy consumption; one often discussed is underground pre-concentration (in situ). It affects directly the energy consuming hoisting and milling. The use of fossil diesel fuel is exstensive and causes environmental burdens. A transition to electric power and battery operation is in progress.</p></li>
<li><p>The discussion of <em>waste management</em> is about to leave as few footprints in nature as possible. We must not leave toxic substances which leak out into nature and the landscape should be restored as far as possible. One solution discussed is <em>in situ mining</em> where as much as possible of the production and processing will take place underground. Such technology is however not without environmental risks and risks for health and safety. Pollution of mine water is the single most important environmental issue for the mining sector and consequently also effective mine water treatment. With regard to water in general it is a question about <em>closing the loop</em>s and re-using the process water as much as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>The environmental debate also includes a discussion on the mining industry's <em>social responsibility</em> for the welfare of the local community. In addition to preserving the environment they are supposed to build a strong technical and social infrastructure that ensures survival of society after mining has ceased.</p></li>
<li><p>Health and safety at work must have top priority. Mechanisation, remote control and automation are efficient preventive safety measures. They are also appropriate for reducing workload to avoid musculoskeletal injuries and allow for recovery periods. New technology makes it possible to both warn of dangerous working conditions and monitor employees' health conditions in real time. Improved safety is also a matter of a developed safety climate in the form of relevant education, rules and effective leadership, with safety prioritised in the day-to-day-work.</p></li>
<li><p>Many problems in the work environment in present mines (and in other industry as well) can be traced back to insufficient initial physical planning and design. Since mining is characterized by huge investments and long term operations it is very important with a well designed physical production system. The physical layout also influences and limits the organizational aspects. If initial mistakes are made the personnel will have to stand the negative consequences for many years to come. The initial design phases of every major development project are therefore critical for establishing a safe and attractive physical and psycho-social work environment in a mine.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Industrie 4.0</em> is based on implementation of Internet of Things, 5G and Big data where the entire production process is included in internet-based networks that transform the mines to smart mines. We will soon see the outlines for Mining 4.0 where miners equipped with mini cameras can for everyday and emergency situations provide their colleagues and senior management with information that is difficult to convey verbally.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The extended business</em> and <em>open collaboration</em> are two concepts where VR technology can be used to link production functions such as planning, mining, maintenance, logistics, purchasing and for coordination of external contractors, suppliers, customers, etc. all connected to a production flow, a value adding chain, where all share the same goal and everyone sees the same whole. Common visualization of problems and opportunities in the system allows for all to optimize the whole chain rather than sub-optimizing parts.</p></li>
<li><p>N<em>ew professional roles</em> with a higher proportion of remote control from production centers and <em>collaborative visualization rooms</em>, perhaps located in nearby communities, or further away (other continents), where the operators have monitoring and coordinating activities across the value chain. Their jobs will change character towards service work and the new tasks require different kinds of skills. In addition to deal with advanced information technology the miners have to interact with different specialist team located all over the world.</p></li>
<li><p>New technology create a new type of work - new in terms of <em>competencies and knowledge</em> as well as workload. There is an emerging, and in many aspects already evident, knowledge transformation – from the old and obsolete physical and tacit knowledge and skills (for example the ability to ‘read the rock’) to something new which can be described as abstract knowledge. This can challenge the identity of the miners and create a resistance to change.</p></li>
<li><p>Future efficient mining operations will be dependent upon a highly competent and well motivated work force, on all levels. The mining companies will have to recruit their personnel from a limited group of talented individuals with high demands and expectations on future work. To cope with the future labour supply, the mining industry must change the image of mining work and increase the attractiveness of working in the sector, especially for young women and men.</p></li>
<li><p>The mines of the future will have a smaller staffing and it is also clear that they will meet a different kind of <em>model for work organization</em> than today. Mining companies will gradually turn to a flat and <em>lean organization</em> with multi-skilled workers who can operate in several areas and functions within the company. There is also a discussion about staffing system based on <em>fly-in fly-out</em> which is more independent of a local community.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are of course other important areas of development, but the above discussed are expressed as the most important from a long-term strategic and sustainable view. A major conclusion is that the challenges and the changes are so large and numerous that a comprehensive international cooperation is needed both within and outside the industry in order to succeed. Working separately would lead to a far to slow development, something that is undesirable for both the companies and the miners. Another conclusion is that a successful mining industry must work simultaneously with all the problems mentioned above. There is a need for a new and modern vision for the whole industry based on a socio-technical approach that covers the whole mining and minerals value adding chain including environmental issues.</p>
