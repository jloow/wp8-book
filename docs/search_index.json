So far it is a work in progress.1 It is a book that intends to give the reader some tools to help them in the social management of new technology. It is aimed chiefly at the mining industry; due to its unique characteristics, much traditional knowledge – or rather, knowledge regarding these issues from other industries – are not readily applicable. Therefore, this book seeks to adapt much of “uncontextualised” knowledge to the mining industry. To do so, we use the technologies of SIMS. About the project The vision of SIMS is to create a long lasting impact on the way we test and demonstrate new technology and solutions for the mining industry. With a selected consortium ranging from mining companies, equipment and system suppliers to top-class universities, the SIMS project will boost development and innovation through joint activities aiming at creating Sustainable Intelligent Mining Systems.

["introduction.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 2. The future of metal mining", " 1 Introduction Today’s mining industry is facing major technical changes. The earlier incremental development will most certainly be replaced by more radical changes based on digitization and the internet of things. These changes must be managed in a socially sustainable way so we don’t create bigger problems than we are solving. We must design tomorrow’s mining so that it can gain social acceptance. Tomorrow’s mining companies must be able to offer safe and attractive workplaces that can attract young people to the industry. In a longer perspective, this can lead to the recognition of the mining industry as an ethical, ecological and diverse industry that can offer challenging jobs and attractive workplaces. The purpose of this book is to provide advice and simple guidance for how to develop and introduce, something we call Social management of new technology. The book is shaped like a Swedish smorgasbord. This means that all chapters can be read independently. One consequence of this is that there may be some repetitions. Most chapters end with a number of summarizing practical advice. The book consists of 22 chapters including this introduction. All chapters are available for computers, tablets and mobile phones on …. Någon adress här? In chapter 2, The future of metal mining, we will discuss the challenges facing today's metal mining industry. We make 15 predictions about the future that should be seen as a contextual background to the discussions in the following chapters In chapter 3, A vision of “The New Attractive Mine”, we have tried to create a vision of a future mine, considering the working environment and attractiveness all the way from the mine planning stage. In chapter 4, What characterizes an attractive mining work?, we have used a general model which describes 22 dimensions of what characterizes an attractive work and applied it to the mining industry. In chapter 5, Attracting young people to the mining industry, we have summarized our findings in six recommendations for creating attractive workplaces and increasing the visibility of the good parts of mining work In chapter 6, Meeting social challenges in established mining communities, we broaden the frame of reference and discuss the mining industry's responsibility to operate in a socially sustainable society. In chapter 7, Risk analysis and prevention, we focus on the safety aspects and present some practical models for risk assessment. We underline the role of the mine planners, they must find solutions that both promote high productivity and good economy as well as safety and a healthy work environment. In chapter 8, Safe and attractive workplaces for contractor personnel, we address that workplace accidents is a problem in relation to outsourcing and contracting. We indicate a number points that can be taken into consideration when aiming to increase safety in these types of work settings. In chapter 9, Understanding, and improving, safety culture, we discuss improved safety culture as a long-term and sustainable safety strategy. We suggests some considerations that mining companies can make when seeking to develop their safety culture In chapter10, Gender and gender equality, we present a brief theoretical background on why gender is an important issue for the mining industry. The chapter ends with some general advice. In chapter 11, Can technology improve gender equality in mining?, the myth is highlighted that new technology will automatically open the mines for women. More systematic work is required to correct the uneven gender balance In chapter 12, Working for gender equality in organizations, we present a practical model for how to work with gender equality, a work that is necessary if mining is to be considered as a modern industry. In chapter 13, Lean mining, we …. In chapter 14, Industry 4.0 in a mining context, we explore the consequences that digitalization and Industry 4.0 can have on future mining work. The vast majority of mining work will be affected by these developments, but miners will not disappear, they will be different in the future. In chapter15, Mining 4.0 - Utopia or Dystopia, we summarize our experiences in two extremes, a negative dystopian development and a positive utopian. The chapter concludes with six recommendations on how to start shaping the future of Mining 4.0 on human terms. In chapter16, Acceptance of new technology, we give a brief overview of the most prominent theories that are important for understanding which factors affect the acceptance of new technologies. In chapter 17, Positioning technology, we discuss the positive effects of positioning technology from a safety perspective and sets it against privacy concerns. Factors that need to be considered to enhance privacy and reduce the perception of misuse are discussed. In chapter18, investing in new technology: guidelines for how to do it right - or to understand what went wrong, we provide guidelines, or statements to consider, when investing in new technology. These questions are meant to aid the organization in the process towards technology that are effective, efficient and accepted from a user perspective. In chapter19, Adapting the technology to the miners, we present a theory for human-centred design, which is a theory for designing equipment, workplaces, tasks and organisations on human terms. In chapter 20, Iterative design of mining workplaces, we describe a circular method for mining planning that is more dynamic than today's linear planning. Furthermore, an iterative process offers more opportunities to create attractive workplaces for both new and existing employees by involving them more in the design process. In chapter 21, More research is needed, we present a research agenda that focuses on to attract and keep skilled personnel in a future high-tech mining industry. In chapter 22, Checklist for safe and attractive mining workplaces, we summarize our results in a practical checklist. There are many aspects, issues and questions that must be considered and addressed in order to achieve safe and attractive mining workplaces. This checklist aims to help highlight potential areas of improvement in a mining workplace that could make it a safer and more attractive workplace, without presenting in-depth solutions that may limit the decision-making process. 1.1 2. The future of metal mining Jan Johansson, Lena Abrahamsson and Bo Johansson In this chapter, we will discuss the challenges facing today's metal mining industry. Our statements about the future should be seen as a contextual background to the discussions that will follow in the following chapters The world's metal mining industry is rapidly changing and faces a number of challenges which must be addressed with a socio-technical approach that covers the whole mining and minerals value adding chain including environmental issues. We have tried to capture this uncertain future in fifteen predictions presented below: Future mining will be shaped in a context where it is necessary to produce at costs that are determined in international competition. The prices of metals and minerals are set by the market but in the long term, there is little doubt that the demand is increasing. Large nations like China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and the whole of Africa will require a larger share of consumption which is leading to the opening of new mines. The difference between these countries' annual “per capita”-consumption and Western Europe can be more than 10 times. Production conditions will be characterized by the fact that the nearby and easily accessible ores will be mined first. New ores will also become more distant or found in the depths. Large ore reserves are located under the sea and there is hardly any doubt that the mining and off-shore companies will develop new technology to extract these. In both cases, production costs will increase. Mining depths increase, and it brings new stability problems. The role of rock mechanics in the design of layouts, cutting sequences, strata stabilization, roof bolting etc. must be a central issue for the future. Full face drilling and cutting should be interesting from a safety perspective, both directly in safer drifting operations and also in that it can create more sthe tablegalleries due to reduced or no blasting damages. Cutting should also be useful for selective mining of high quality ore in narrow ore bodies. Production drilling and blasting for controlled fragmentation are two very crucial operations in the ore mining cycle. Improvements in these operations opens up many possibilities for automation. The environmental requirements affect both energy consumption and management of ore tailings. The discussion of energy consumption is largely linked to global warming and carbon emissions. Today not all nations have joined the Paris Climate Agreement, but in the long term, some form of coordination surely will be established. The cost of emission allowances will be a significant factor to consider. The mining industry is an energy-intensive industry with high CO2 emission. Improvement of energy efficiency will increase the economic profitability as well as reducing environmental impact. There are many components that affect the total energy consumption; one often discussed is underground pre-concentration (in situ). It affects directly the energy consuming hoisting and milling. The use of fossil diesel fuel is exstensive and causes environmental burdens. A transition to electric power and battery operation is in progress. The discussion of waste management is about to leave as few footprints in nature as possible. We must not leave toxic substances which leak out into nature and the landscape should be restored as far as possible. One solution discussed is in situ mining where as much as possible of the production and processing will take place underground. Such technology is however not without environmental risks and risks for health and safety. Pollution of mine water is the single most important environmental issue for the mining sector and consequently also effective mine water treatment. With regard to water in general it is a question about closing the loops and re-using the process water as much as possible. The environmental debate also includes a discussion on the mining industry's social responsibility for the welfare of the local community. In addition to preserving the environment they are supposed to build a strong technical and social infrastructure that ensures survival of society after mining has ceased. Health and safety at work must have top priority. Mechanisation, remote control and automation are efficient preventive safety measures. They are also appropriate for reducing workload to avoid musculoskeletal injuries and allow for recovery periods. New technology makes it possible to both warn of dangerous working conditions and monitor employees' health conditions in real time. Improved safety is also a matter of a developed safety climate in the form of relevant education, rules and effective leadership, with safety prioritised in the day-to-day-work. Many problems in the work environment in present mines (and in other industry as well) can be traced back to insufficient initial physical planning and design. Since mining is characterized by huge investments and long term operations it is very important with a well designed physical production system. The physical layout also influences and limits the organizational aspects. If initial mistakes are made the personnel will have to stand the negative consequences for many years to come. The initial design phases of every major development project are therefore critical for establishing a safe and attractive physical and psycho-social work environment in a mine. Industrie 4.0 is based on implementation of Internet of Things, 5G and Big data where the entire production process is included in internet-based networks that transform the mines to smart mines. We will soon see the outlines for Mining 4.0 where miners equipped with mini cameras can for everyday and emergency situations provide their colleagues and senior management with information that is difficult to convey verbally. The extended business and open collaboration are two concepts where VR technology can be used to link production functions such as planning, mining, maintenance, logistics, purchasing and for coordination of external contractors, suppliers, customers, etc. all connected to a production flow, a value adding chain, where all share the same goal and everyone sees the same whole. Common visualization of problems and opportunities in the system allows for all to optimize the whole chain rather than sub-optimizing parts. New professional roles with a higher proportion of remote control from production centers and collaborative visualization rooms, perhaps located in nearby communities, or further away (other continents), where the operators have monitoring and coordinating activities across the value chain. Their jobs will change character towards service work and the new tasks require different kinds of skills. In addition to deal with advanced information technology the miners have to interact with different specialist team located all over the world. New technology create a new type of work - new in terms of competencies and knowledge as well as workload. There is an emerging, and in many aspects already evident, knowledge transformation – from the old and obsolete physical and tacit knowledge and skills (for example the ability to ‘read the rock’) to something new which can be described as abstract knowledge. This can challenge the identity of the miners and create a resistance to change. Future efficient mining operations will be dependent upon a highly competent and well motivated work force, on all levels. The mining companies will have to recruit their personnel from a limited group of talented individuals with high demands and expectations on future work. To cope with the future labour supply, the mining industry must change the image of mining work and increase the attractiveness of working in the sector, especially for young women and men. The mines of the future will have a smaller staffing and it is also clear that they will meet a different kind of model for work organization than today. Mining companies will gradually turn to a flat and lean organization with multi-skilled workers who can operate in several areas and functions within the company. There is also a discussion about staffing system based on fly-in fly-out which is more independent of a local community. There are of course other important areas of development, but the above discussed are expressed as the most important from a long-term strategic and sustainable view. A major conclusion is that the challenges and the changes are so large and numerous that a comprehensive international cooperation is needed both within and outside the industry in order to succeed. Working separately would lead to a far to slow development, something that is undesirable for both the companies and the miners. Another conclusion is that a successful mining industry must work simultaneously with all the problems mentioned above. There is a need for a new and modern vision for the whole industry based on a socio-technical approach that covers the whole mining and minerals value adding chain including environmental issues. "],
["a-vision-of-the-new-attractive-mine.html", "2 A vision of \"The New Attractive Mine", " 2 A vision of \"The New Attractive Mine Bo Johansson and Jan Johansson In this chapter we have tried to create a vision of a future mine, considering the working environment and attractiveness all the way from the mine planning stage. The new deep metal mine was a true planning and co-operation success and a huge leap in mining history. A number of leading “European mining companies” had been inspired by the EU project \"Sustained intelligent mining industry\" abbreviated as SIMS. This successful project had provided a conceptual system for automated and flexible mining, based on drill and blast technology for fragmentation of the actual ore. Continuous mining with road headers was still only used in development works where conventional drilling and blasting was abandoned. The zero entry mine was now almost realised and the large “European manufacturers of advanced mining equipment” had contributed largely to the technological success, which had opened a new global market for them. The new automated mining method made it possible to almost continuously produce desired ore qualities and quantities on customers demand. This was a big comparative advantage compared to the old traditional bulk production mines that still existed and struggled for their survival. The new mining system dramatically reduced the prevailing and traditional use of expensive storing and stacking of mined ore. With the new way to mine an important first step towards true Lean-mining was taken and gradually one bottle neck after another was discovered and eliminated. Metal recovery was very high and cut-off grades were reduced. It seemed as traditional mining had been a real waste of resources. Advanced investment analyses had clearly shown that there were great financial benefits with the new automated mining technology. The costs for underground development works were reduced with about 50% compared with traditional mining methods and labour costs were reduced with more than that. This made it possible for the companies to make large investments in new technology and personnel competence and still be highly profithe tableIf profits for society and individuals also were included in the analysis the total expected financial benefits where overwhelming. Follow up of actual economical results showed even bigger savings than expected. An unusual feature of the new mine was that open pit mining was avoided although the upper parts of the ore body were close to the surface. A green mining philosophy “In situ mining” was applied and most of the mining activities were invisible for people passing the mine site. Most of the waste material was directly used for backfill after recovering the metal content. The mining companies had from the start of the project made use of a newly developed iterative planning methodology that reduced common initial design errors when they designed the new mine. Basic guidelines provided very useful demands for the mine designers. During the development works there had for example never been any real ventilation problems, stability problems or water drainage problems. No severe accidents or incidents had occurred so far and all mining activities were systematically risk assessed. The new mine had set a new world standard for results regarding health and safety results. Safety first was not only a simple a slogan, it was a complex and applied reality. In fact no major physical work or main activities were performed unless they had been computer simulated, evaluated and approved. This proactive way to handle production and safety risks had proven its value time after time. The old description of mining work as “Dark, dirty and dangerous” had definitively become out of date and irrelevant. Instead of being almost unpredicthe tableand uncertain mining had become highly predicthe tableSome of the old miners meant that the original charm of mining was somewhat lost when all worked according to plans, but no one really wanted the old risky ways and days back. One key to the success was the fact that the mine was already from the start designed for automation and socio technical principles with a work organization based on production teams and broad professional skills among management and miners. One of the mines most impressive features was the information and decision systems based on sensor technology and production analysis in real time. This made it possible for the personnel to actively steer and control the production instead of just passively react on deviations and alarms from an automated production process. This was a major difference and advantage compared with traditional control room work, in for example regular processing plants. Impressive results regarding product quality and production availability and stability had been achieved due to this proactive philosophy. The philosophy also made the miners work interesting and challenging. The new remote operations control centres (so called ROCs) were designed to promote co-operation and creative problem solving in multi skilled teams. The working teams were mixed regarding age, experience, gender, competence, etc. Diversity had replaced conformity and this had proved to be a good base for creating “production scouts”, miners that were always ready and interested in improving the mining processes. Most of the team members were recruited from national and regional education programs that were specially developed with regards to the new demands that the mining sector had, basically that modern mining was an intellectual analytical work for wise and reliable persons. New education programs on all levels had been started and were recruiting well. Mining work had turned to be attractive, not only because the wages, but also because it was a very interesting work with good possibilities for personal and professional development in a safe and sound working environment. The total progress had been astonishing although they only have started to utilize parts of the potential that the new technology and organisation offered. Investments in research and development work had paid off quickly and management were convinced that innovative R &amp; D combined with a challenging vision had been and would continue to be the key factor for success.

["what-characterizes-an-attractive-mining-work.html", "3 What characterizes an attractive mining work? 3.1 Attractive working conditions 3.2 Attractive work content 3.3 Work satisfaction", " 3 What characterizes an attractive mining work? Erik As mentioned in chapter 2, the mining industry has had difficulty with hiring people from younger generations and should as such look for ways to improve the attractiveness of mining workplaces. However, it is not so easy to know what characterizes an attractive mining work. We have chosen to use a general model which consists of 22 dimensions described by Åteg, Hedlund and Pontén [1]. In an effort to investigate if and how these aspects of attractive work could be applied to mining workplaces, Lööw, Johansson, Andersson, &amp; Johansson [1], examined the 22 dimensions and their relation to the mining industry. Below is a list describing each of the dimensions which includes descriptions of how they are best fulfilled and how mining workplaces are affected by and can affect the attractiveness of the workplace. 3.1 Attractive working conditions Adequate equipment and tools: Modern equipment capable of providing good results efficiently and safely should be provided. Equipment should be designed to accommodate people of different sizes and with different needs. The equipment in the mining industry has a history of having trouble accommodating the people that use them. With new technologies comes opportunities to design attractive equipment that accommodate both new and existing employees’ needs. Leadership: There should exist proper trust, communication and cooperation between employees and management. Management should feel safe in letting the operators have more control over the planning and execution of work tasks and with letting them partake in decision-making. Employees should feel like they can safely give suggestions and voice concerns, while also trusting that management will take their needs into account when making changes. Location: It’s important that the workplace is located close to home, that there is proper transportation to work and that the surrounding society is developed. Mining companies cannot easily accommodate this aspect due to being bound by mineral deposits’ locations. However, providing adequate transportation and housing, and investing in local societies, they can mitigate the negative effects on attractiveness. While bringing in personnel through Fly in/Fly out-methods is an alternative, European mines generally try to avoid relying on them. Loyalty: Employees should be loyal to and be treated with loyalty from the company, their colleagues and across organisational boundaries by cooperating and making sacrifices for each other. Establishing trust is an important factor for promoting loyalty. Management must ensure that the employees can trust them to make decisions and changes that are designed with their needs in mind. Another important factor is to provide transparency. Management should detail and explain how and why certain decisions are taken, which in turn helps build trust. Organisation: A successful company can be more attractive, in addition to having low turnover, being in a good economic situation and providing advancement possibilities and benefits. The size of the organisation also affects the attractiveness, where smaller companies tend to be more attractive. In modern mining companies, there is a trend amongst organizations to adapt something called Lean mining. It is meant to help rationalise and make their productions and organisations more effective by implementing Lean philosophies. It entails a focus on quality of infrastructure and safety, production uptime, flexible and multi-skilled workers, and teamwork. Physical work environment: Attractive locales should have nice appearances and furnishing, pollutant-free air, low sound levels and they should be clean. The move towards control room work helps mitigate negative impacts by removing the operators from the potentially risky mining workplaces for much of the work. Proper ventilation, noise protection and tunnels clear from debris is vital for a good work environment in a mine, even with more remote-controlled work. Relations: The employees need relations at the workplace that provide support and empathy, with good team spirit, camaraderie, cooperation, honesty and so on. Future mining work provides good opportunities to develop good work relationships with your colleagues if team members work in the same control rooms. Social contact: The workplace allows for social interactions with other people, such as customers or colleagues. With control room work, people can more easily speak with their colleagues face-to-face. As mining work may sometimes require working alone, proper equipment for communication should be provided to avoid isolating operators. Wage: It is important that the wage provided is of a sufficient level, that it allows for people to support themselves and that it gradually increases. Wages in mining workplaces are generally higher than average, which could contribute to attractiveness should other factors be addressed. Wages shouldn’t be based on produced results, both to provide a sthe tablewage and to promote healthier ways of working. This is due to piece rate wages having been shown to increase the risk for workplace accidents to occur as it leads to safety procedures being neglected to increase production rates. Working hours: Reasonable working hours that are predetermined and configurable can make a workplace more attractive. The employees should always know when they start and get off work while also being able to influence the scope, distribution over the week and plan vacations. Mining usually relies on around-the-clock working hours. Setting up offices in larger cities that remotely control machines in the mines far away would access a larger employee base, making it easier to find people willing to accommodate these working hours. Working in extended shifts of 10-12 hours is common in the mining industry, but it increases the risk for accidents to occur the longer the shift. As such, it should be avoided in favour of more standard working hours at around 8 hours per shift. 3.2 Attractive work content Familiarity: The employee should know what to do and what to expect in the workplace. This requires proper training, access to work instructions and an incentive to utilize that information. With the implementation of 5G in mines and a digitalization of work, it will become easier to communicate with others and access work instructions whenever needed, even when below ground. Freedom of action: The employees should be able to organize and control their own and others’ work, for instance by influencing the planning and execution of work tasks. Working from control rooms and with digitalized systems could give more opportunities for controlling one’s work. For example, operators could more easily swap between and choose which machines in what parts of the mine to operate. Freedom of action could also be provided by placing the lowest planning level on the work group level. Management would no longer need to create individual plans and schedules for each employee. Instead, the work groups would be provided with goals and missions after which they could plan their work accordingly, thus giving the work groups more control over their work. Physical activity: The workplace should allow and include healthy physical activity and movement to help prevent employees from suffering static work-related injuries or health problems. After the automation, mechanisation and digitalization of the mining industry, there will still be physical activities available, for example through maintenance work. Having the operators alternate between these tasks and control room work would help vary the otherwise very static workplace. Practical work: The workplace should include practical and creative work tasks with handheld machines or tools to break from working only with computers or control systems. This aspect can also benefit from including maintenance work to vary the control room work. Furthermore, since the new technologies will likely require adapting into the already complex mining systems of today, there will be opportunities for more creative work through retrofitting. Mental work: Work tasks or problem solving should include cognitive work in addition to physical work and should be performed cooperatively with colleagues and management. This should include workplace learning, development and training. Control room work in mining industries offer many opportunities for mental work and brings groups of operators together to the same workplace. A more digitalized organisation would enable easier communication and cooperation between groups that would otherwise rarely meet. Variation: Throughout the day, employees should be provided opportunities for job rotation, development of work tasks and flexibility in ways to perform the tasks. This is to prevent potential ergonomic and mental loads from working with the same tasks repeatedly. While the remote-controlled mining workplaces may allow for rotating between work tasks, there might be less variation between tasks as they would all be controlled through computer systems in control rooms. Including maintenance work tasks could help introduce more variation in work content and working environments, making the job less monotonous. Variation between work tasks require that the employees are trained in how to handle the different tasks. Work pace: The work pace should include both intensive and calm periods in order to engage people while also providing opportunities for rest and reflection. Since the work pace in mining is continuous around the clock, there are few calm periods outside of assigned breaks. Introducing autonomous or semi-autonomous machines to the mining workplace would allow for more opportunities for calmer periods during the work. As an example, mining vehicles could autonomously drive to their destination, allowing the operator a short break from active work. The operator could then take control during more complicated or critical tasks once the vehicle has arrived. 3.3 Work satisfaction A demand for the person: Workplaces where the employees feel like they are needed and that they perform important work are generally considered to be more attractive. As the mining industry needs more skilful people and people from younger generations, those people may become more interested in the job if that demand can be communicated to them. Potential ways to communicate the demand could include having a presence in mining-related educations to show students that they are in demand. Existing employees could feel more appreciated if the importance of their knowledge and skillsets is made more apparent for them. Recognition: The employees should themselves feel that they have done a good job, in addition to being provided recognition for their work from management, colleagues or customers. Good performance should be rewarded according to the employee’s subjective preference; perhaps through a monetary reward or through more time off. Results: The employees need to clearly understand what the results of their work is and how it contributes to the workplace. The switch from operating the machines yourself to controlling them from a remote control room could cause some disconnect to their work for the employees. Working from a control room with more digital systems provides a good opportunity to visualise and present the operators with an overview of the entire mine process. Status: The workplace contributes to and strengthens an employee’s sense of pride, success and professional identity. Companies must communicate to their employees the value of their work and their knowledge. The mining industry has had an image of heavy, tough and dirty but profithe tablework for a long time. The change towards more digital and remote work could impact that image, and in turn impact people’s perception of the industry. As many existing employees have established a sense of pride for working in the current mining industry, changing the way mines are operated might negatively affect the attractiveness of the job for them. At the same time, moving towards the implementation of more modern technologies could make the industry more attractive towards younger generations of employees. Stimulation: The workplace provides an opportunity for the employees to put in effort and use their skills in their work. The work being too difficult can be demoralizing for them, while it being too easy can lower the employees’ motivation. The mining workplaces of today and of the future both provide opportunities for stimulating work, however they may be stimulating in different ways. A current employee may find future mining workplaces to be unstimulating, while future employees may find it opposite. Regardless of what subjective views employees have of the work, they need to be provided with proper training and support if the work is difficult to them. While these dimensions cover many of the aspects that can affect the attractiveness of work, there is one important subject that remains largely unmentioned: gender. Creating workplaces that are attractive for and accommodate both men and women is important if the mining industry wants to address the issue of hiring younger people and skilful people. If not, the mining industry runs the risk of driving away many potential applicants that could have otherwise been interested. Even though mining workplaces have the potential to fulfil the dimensions of attractiveness, it could still be difficult to accommodate for each of these aspects at once. However, this doesn’t mean that the workplace cannot be attractive if it only fulfils most or some aspects. What is important is that the parts of the workplace that negatively affect attractiveness are being compensated for through other positive aspects to ensure that the negative impact is lessened. For example, if heavy and ergonomically unhealthy tasks are unavoidable, supportive equipment and opportunities for rest in between can be used to lessen the negative impact. That way, an image of a safe and accessible workplace can better be conveyed and maintained. References "],
["attracting-young-people-to-the-mining-industry.html", "4 Attracting young people to the mining industry", " 4 Attracting young people to the mining industry Jan Johansson, Bo Johansson, Joel Lööw, Magnus Nygren and Lena Abrahamsson In most mines the present workforce is ageing and mining companies have difficulties recruiting young talented people. A precondition for being able to recruit the right workforce is that the mining industry can offer workplaces that attract the youths of tomorrow. In order to succeed, the mining companies need to know what in fact constitute attractive jobs and workplaces in mining as well as how they can change their own present operations to align with these requirements. These changes need to be based on current and relevant research on work attractiveness. However, labour supply is determined not only by the work itself and the working environment but just as much of the society and what it can offer its residents. There are a number of factors that have an impact on the attractiveness of society, such as social relations to family, friends and relatives, opportunities regarding work and education, housing and leisure activities. These factors must also be considered when creating the mines of the future. Unfortunately, there is no single accepted definition of what constitutes an attractive job and current explanations and models differ. While pay and the possibilities of advancement are two general factors, answers have varied in, for example, different time periods and fields of research. It follows that what is attractive also differs between countries, since the general contexts differ, as well as individuals. A general model for attractive work is presented by Åteg et al. (2004). In this model, three factors, covering 22 dimensions (see The table), interact and contribute to the attractiveness of work. For a detailed description of the various dimensions, see Chapter 4. In comparison with previous, similar models Åteg et al. have added work satisfaction as a factor. This factor is especially important for keeping people at work, Åteg et al. argue. Work attractiveness. Attractive working conditions Attractive work content Work satisfaction Adequate equipment and tools Working hours Physical work environment Leadership Loyalty Location Wage Organization Relations Social contact Work pace Familiarity Physical activity Freedom to act Practical work Theoretical work Variation Demand, need Recognition Status Stimulation Results In another model, Hedlund [1] states that a job is attractive for a person if he/she wants the job and wants to keep it. Thus, an individual can judge the attractiveness both as an applicant (external view) and as an employee (internal view). This means that a job can be described in four different ways: attractive, hidden, idealized and unattractive (see Figure 1). Accordingly, a job is attractive if it has a high attractiveness from both an internal and an external point of view. A job with high internal attractiveness but low external attractiveness is classified as hidden, while a job with low internal attractiveness but high external attractiveness is regarded as idealized. Finally, a job that has a low attractiveness from both an internal and external view is classified as unattractive. Thus an individual’s relation to work, experience of work and wishes and expectations are important components that form the perception of work attractiveness, i.e. different people have varying opinions of the same job depending on their personal situation and preferences. In essence, it can be said that the relative importance of each dimension in the model by Åteg et al. (2004) depend on the individual. Additionally, we argue that the weight of a dimension may even be negative. This has the effect that an “objectively” attractive job may be perceived as unattractive. The attractiveness of the mining industry illustrated. In Figure 1 we have used Hedlund’s (2007) model to illustrate a plausible present situation for the mining sector. The attractive section is quite small and the view from an internal position is more positive than one from an external position. Thus we argue that the mining industry needs to expand job attractiveness, both for external and internal viewers. As was shown in the above models, this expansion can be achieved in a large number of ways. Essentially, present attractive qualities must be presented and not hidden away from applicants and potential staff. Unattractive or repelling job features must be eliminated or decreased. The question is how to achieve this expansion of attractiveness. Based on our experiences from the SIMS project and other similar projects, we have summarized our findings in six recommendations for creating attractive workplaces and increasing the visibility of the good parts of mining work: Health and safety at work must have top priority. Mechanization, remote control, and automation are efficient preventive safety measures, but are also appropriate for reducing workload to avoid musculoskeletal injuries and allow for recovery periods. Improved safety is also a matter of a developed safety climate in the form of relevant education, rules and effective leadership where safety clearly is prioritized in the day-to-day-work. A work organization based on groups as an operative unit where all employees have control over their own work cycle. This very concrete demand guarantees a variety at work while also providing meaningful autonomy. The demand can also be combined with a Lean approach. Competence development, and learning at work are important to guarantee flexibility for the company and development in one’s professional role. It is also a question about changing into a workplace culture that follows the developments in the industry, such as new production techniques, new products, and new quality demands. Gender equality is essential for the mining industry to being viewed as a modern employer. The industry must break away from its macho-masculine image. The mining companies must more actively demonstrate their social responsibility. Employees want to feel proud to work in the company, so issues such as vision, mission and core values are important. Focus should be placed on the benefits as well as the potential problems that may come with having a workforce consisting of both in-house personnel and contractors. This includes an emphasis on strengthening both the formal (e.g. implementing joint safety management practices) and informal (e.g. communication and interaction on a workplace level) relations on the emerging multi-employer worksites. Finally, if the mining industry wants to improve its image and recruit young people in the future, they have to broaden their perspective. New technology is important and can solve many problems, but not all of them. Technology must be complemented with a social perspective that includes attractive and safe workplaces in a social functioning society, sought-after workplaces in a company that people are proud to work for.

["meeting-social-challenges-in-established-mining-communities.html", "5 Meeting social challenges in established mining communities", " 5 Meeting social challenges in established mining communities Eugenia In this chapter we will broaden the frame of reference and discuss the mining industry's responsibility to operate in a socially sustainable society. By “established mining communities” we mean communities that co-exist with ongoing mines and mining companies. In Sweden, these communities are often rural and small or mid-sized towns. Such towns face many practical challenges that provide both possibilities and obstacles to supporting socially sustainable development, challenges that they in varying degrees share with mining communities in countries such as Norway, Finland, Australia, and Canada. Many of these communities have always been, and indeed still are, at the mercy of global market fluctuations in the mining, steel, and forestry sectors. They are situated in districts that are home to highly valued natural areas, major tourist attractions, and mixed populations where indigenous peoples are an important presence; in some cases, these areas are sources for important and difficult discussions and debates, and sometimes even overt conflicts. Examples of deep-rooted and persistent problems in these communities are: low education levels (especially among men); depopulation (as women and young people move away); economic stagnation; downsized welfare services; and a low level of activity in other sectors (trade, housing, communication, and infrastructure); as well as a gender-segregated labor market with a low degree of differentiation. Those two last aspects distinguish industrial communities from small rural communities. In addition, these areas are often characterized by a social construction of rural citizens (especially men) as “old-fashioned” and culturally conservative. The problems outlined above are undoubtedly substantial, but some of them, however, are offset by periods of more positive trends such as a low level of unemployment, new investments in housing and infrastructure, and growing entrepreneurial activity. A lot of those challenges are relevant for rural industrial communities, but some are specific to mining communities. During periods when mining is booming the problems change character and become related to, for example, lack of housing and infrastructure, and the difficulty in recruiting new employees with the right skills, both for the mining companies and other ancillary businesses and welfare services such as health care. Other major challenges relate to the environment; more specifically, how to balance the mining companies’ need for efficient licensing with environmental concerns? Moreover, even if we can see an emerging diversity of livelihoods, the recent mining boom mainly led to an increase in activity in businesses and industries that have long been dominated by men Aspects of urban life in established mining communities such as social cohesion and inclusion, migration and demographics, good housing infrastructure, and gender equality can enable (or disable, in a figurative sense) diversity of livelihoods in those communities. A strong community identity can be seen as good grounds for social cohesion, but at the same time this can be associated with a certain lifestyle that is not inclusive – for example if this lifestyle has a connection with traditional (specifically rural and mining worker) masculinity. When it comes to social cohesion and inclusion, some studies focus on the local community with respect to decision-making processes (e.g. issuing a “social license to mine”). Swedish studies of mining communities discuss strong community identity, which can be seen as promoting cohesion, but as alluded to above this identity is often associated with a certain lifestyle that is not inclusive and is characterized by “traditional masculinities”. Some international studies have also found mining communities to be notably cohesive internally, but local networks were not considered strong and inclusive. Crawley and Sinclair [1] have examined how to broaden a mining company’s recruitment base by including indigenous people, a strategy based on power sharing. The conclusions in the study placed high hopes on the then upcoming UN declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People that was adopted in 2007. One might argue though that the UN declaration lacked the ability to alter the normative environment for mining companies. Indeed, the aftermath of the declaration proved to be something of a disappointment in that it became clear that it did not – perhaps could not – change things anywhere near enough for indigenous people; rather, positive advances would, as so often in the past, come from local pressures exerted and directed from below. There is an undeniable ambition to preserve indigenous peoples’ cultural expressions. Australian and North American studies have examined how the mining industry has negatively affected indigenous people by severely limiting their ability to practice their traditional lifestyle. The concern is often with indigenous peoples’ rights and access to prior, free, and informed consent to mine, for example, as these issues relate to international law. The practical implications of these challenges are the following Measures towards community cohesion might be problematic Social licensing should be a continuous process, a dialogue between the mining company and the established mining community Working towards less gender-segregated local labor market is essential It’s important to work for indigenous peoples’ rights and access to prior, free, and informed consent to mine References "],
["risk-analysis-and-prevention.html", "6 Risk analysis and prevention", " 6 Risk analysis and prevention Jan Johansson and Bo Johansson, A heavy responsibility for safe mines lays on the mine planners’ shoulders. They must find solutions that promote high productivity and good economy as well as safety and a healthy work environment. The mine planners will initially shape the general and specific work environment for miners for many years to come. If the planners design a poor solution and it is necessary to redesign it, it will also probably be very expensive to correct after it has been implemented. Work environment and safety issues are unfortunately often left quite unattended in the early stages of mine planning and design when they instead should be systematically highlighted and developed from the very first planning steps. The best and most efficient way to gain safety is through proactive planning instead of reactive corrective actions. It is also the best way to reduce the associated costs for risk elimination and reduction. The mine planner is however not alone, he or she works in a company context where safety climate and culture, safety policy and safety management have a strong influence on how well the planner can succeed in his or her work. The slogan “Safety first” has been heard in the mining business for many decades but is still in many cases no more than a slogan since safety first is not fully practiced, especially if the business has financial problems. It seems however that the times are changing and many mining companies are now making great efforts to improve their safety climate and safety culture. Research on safety has shown that at positive safety climate and well developed safety culture is an important requisite for a healthy and safe work environment, especially in heavy industries. In order to manage the risks in the business every mining company is also in need of a strategic long-term policy regarding how to deal with safety issues and strive for better work conditions. The safety policy shall direct and establish systematic ways to manage (plan, steer and control) the safety work, also including early planning and design activities. Because mining is a very risky business it has to follow and obey a lot of directives, laws and provisions. Most of these rules only stipulate minimum demands and the companies are free to exceed them. This is also what mine planners should aim at, exceeding minimum demands. A first step for a mine planner is therefore to get acquainted with the national and international (ie EU regulations) system of rules and basic demands. Many of these demands are provided by the national or EU authorities. This has to be done in a thorough way in each country there are quite a large number of directives, laws and provisions that regulate and give guidelines for health and safety issues in underground mining. The basis for all activities in systematic health and safety work shall always be an initial thorough risk assessment both of the present state and a future planned state. It is of course easier to assess present or historical risks than future risks, especially if the future holds large changes in technology and or work organization. Still a mine planner needs to assess the risks with different mining concepts that are developed and planned. Mining might develop in a revolutionary way, but will most probably develop in another way, in an evolutionary way. This means that much can be learned from history and from the present state. Thorough evaluations of present and historic designs have for example systematically been used by the Swedish mining company LKAB in the design of their newest main level at 1365 m below surface. This evaluation has been very important since the time span from the first conceptual designs to the final solutions has stretched over 12 years and a large number of planners. Risk assessments can be performed in number of ways depending on the situation and circumstances. All risk assessment shall however be based on probability and consequence for unwanted events. A practical tool for this purpose is a risk matrix that eases a systematic and consequent risk assessment, se below. Very common - 1/week R3 R4 R5 R5 R5 Common - 1/month R2 R3 R4 R5 R5 Relatively common - 1/år R2 R3 R3 R4 R5 Quite unusual - 1/10 år R1 R2 R3 R3 R4 Not probable - 1/100 år R1 R1 R2 R2 R3 Probability Consequence Some discomfort but harmless Injury but no sick leave Short sick leave Long sick leave Permanent serious injury or death Figure 7.1. Risk matrix based on probability and consequence. As can be seen in figure 7.1 probability is expressed as a frequency for a specific event or deviation. The assessed risk level during planning can also be coupled to a specified need for action, se below. Risk level Need for action during planning R1 Low risk – negligible risk No need for any redesign of the basic concept R2 Small risk A limited redesign of the basic concept might not be needed R3 Average risk – certain risk A thorough redesign of the basic concept is recommended for parts related to identified risks R4 Severe risk A redesign of major parts of the basic concept is necessary to reach a less than average risk R5 Very severe risk Any further development of the design concept is not permitted until the identified risk is reduced to a less than average risk Figure 7.2. Risk level and need for action during planning The risk matrix for risk assessments during planning can also with some modification be used for risk assessments in the operative production stages. The risk matrix has therefore become a quite well known and used tool in the mining companies. Risk level Need for action during production R1 Low risk – negligible risk No need for action R2 Small risk Action might not be needed within months R3 Average risk – certain risk Reasonable risk reduction needed within a week R4 Severe risk Promt action is necessary within hours R5 Very severe risk Work is not permitted until risk is reduced to an accepthe tablelevel Figure 7.3. Risk level and need for action during production The classical tools for the identification of occupational risks in the existing production environments are Safety rounds, Incident and Accident reporting. These tools are however less suithe tableto identify and assess risks in future work environments. There you need other types of more proactive methods such as: Preventive deviation analysis Preventive energy analysis A deviation is according to Harms-Ringdahl [1] defined as an event or condition that deviates from the intended or normal. The purpose of a deviation analysis is to prevent, to predict abnormalities that can cause damage and to develop proposals to improve safety measures. Deviation Analysis is a very useful method since it takes into account the entire system, Human-Technology-Organization. Energy analysis focuses more on technology and might be useful when developing new productions systems. Three main components considered in an energy analysis are: Energy that can damage Targets that may be harmed Barriers to Energy The energies usually considered are: Gravity, height (including static load); Linear motion; Rotary motion; Stored pressure; Electrical energy; Heating and cooling; Fire and explosion; Chemical effects; Radiation; Miscellaneous (human movement, sharp edges, and points). There are also many other different risk analysis methods that can be used during the development of new production systems. Besides the methods mentioned above methods like Preventive Work Safety Analysis (PWSA), Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Event Tree Analysis (ETA), Work Environment Screening Tool (WEST) etc. are possible to use. The most appropriate tools have to be chosen for every specific analysis task and the users of the tools must also have the necessary competence in order to attain reliable and relevant results. Here the mining business probably can learn much from other industries that have strong safety cultures and long experience of systematic risk management. Especially important will be to learn how to proactively manage risks for fatalities and other severe risks. Here so called leading indicators are preferred instead of lagging indicators. Even if there are many risk evaluation tools available the mining industry seems to need new and efficient tools for description, evaluation and design of work environment during early phases of strategic decision making and production system design. The most important decisions regarding work environment and safety are made by top management when mining methods, technology, work organization etc. are decided. Therefore risk analyses regarding these matters should be made as early as possible in the mine design process. Once a risk analysis is completed it often requires measures which in most situations should be implemented in the following well known order: Prevent already in the planning stage, replace the hazards entirely. For example, through automation to eliminate manual or mechanized underground work. Isolate the individual hazard, risk process. For example, by designing ventilation and layout so that the blasting fumes can’t be spread outside the risk zone. Change process technology and behavior. For example, DTH-drilling with water hydraulics rather than pneumatics to reduce dust emissions. Limit the hazard through enclosures, physical protection. For example, build concrete borders and railings at the shaft openings. Isolate personnel from the hazard risk area. For example, by supplying the mining vehicles with safety cabs with good climate control. Risk is reduced by instructions, procedures, training, etc. For example, procedures for safe handling of explosives. Risk is reduced through personal protective equipment. For example, functional working clothes. Depending on the complexity and severity of problems one may require different combinations of measures as described above. One recommendation is to always try to attack the root causes of the problem first. It tends to result in the most cost efficient and result efficient solutions. This is an important task for mine planners. They have the best opportunity to eliminate a lot of potential health and safety problems when they develop the first conceptual solutions. Planners that don’t realize this and neglect these matters can cause great harm for many years to the mining personnel and their company. References "],
["safe-and-attractive-workplaces-for-contractor-personnel.html", "7 Safe and attractive workplaces for contractor personnel", " 7 Safe and attractive workplaces for contractor personnel Magnus It is common practice in the contemporary mining industry to hire contractors to perform certain work tasks. This has led to the emergence of multi-employer worksites where workers from different companies are active in close proximity to each other. This poses specific challenges when it comes to health and safety and, by extension, work attractiveness. Workplace accidents, in particular, have historically been a problem in relation to outsourcing and contracting. Muzaffar et al [1] show that the odds for contractor employees sustaining a fatal injury while performing work in the US mining industry were almost three times higher compared to the mining companies’ own personnel. In the Swedish mining industry, contractor workers have likewise regularly had higher accident rates in recent years Svemin [1]. The matter of certain groups of workers potentially having an increased risk of suffering accidents is important to address in its own right. However, it is also important to consider from the perspective of recruitment and ensuring work attractiveness. In a literature review of research on safety on multi-employer worksites, Nygren et al [1] propose that a number of key concepts and terms can be found and divided into three overlapping categories (figure 8.1). Category Key concepts and terms Contract work characteristics High workload Insufficient training Low autonomy and task demand Normalization of risk Time constraints Temporary and/or peripheral work Unfamiliarity with work environment Structural/ organizational factors and conditions Communication barriers Disorganization effects Substandard division of responsibility Ineffective and insufficient information sharing Unsthe tablesocial relations Cultural conditions Cultural integration difficulties Culture of independence Differing norms and values Macho-masculine work culture Figure 8.1. Examples of key concepts and terms Nygren et al [1]. As seen, research on the subject mainly highlights the safety-related problems that arise when contractors are hired, rather than the benefits that multi-employer arrangements may bring. In line with Mayhew et al (1997), Nygren et al [1] argue that much of the problems can be connected to two main factors: Economic pressures Disorganization The first factor, economic pressures, highlights that contractors (and in particular smaller companies) may not invest in health and safety-related matters due to a lack of resources. This includes less systematized management practices as well as a lack of comprehensive safety education and training. The second factor, disorganization, focuses on the organizational conditions for safety. Multi-employer worksites are often characterized by complex contracting chains with contractors hiring other (sub)contractors, or multiple contractors being hired by a mining company for different projects. This can lead to unclear relationships between groups of workers, ambiguity in the organization of work, as well as a breakdown in communication and substandard division of management responsibilities. Given that mining companies are relying on contractors to a significant extent, the concept of work attractiveness should be expanded to also include the conditions that arise in multi-employer arrangements. The following points can be taken into consideration when aiming to increase safety in these types of work settings – and, by extension, work attractiveness for contractor personnel: The mining company should make sure that the contractors have well-functioning health and safety management systems in place, including a clear division of roles and responsibilities. Safety education and training should be a prerequisite for conducting work in the industry, regardless of employer. This should also be documented in the form of, e.g., certificates of completed courses. The work needs to be scheduled carefully, include realistic time frames, and communicated clearly to everyone involved. This includes the mining company informing the contractors of any/all adjacent work by other companies that will be conducted simultaneously. Meetings should be organized where health and safety-related issues are discussed, as a way of encouraging that risks and hazards are shared between companies and between workers. The responsibility for organizing these meetings should lie on the party that owns and oversees the operation in question, i.e. representatives from the mining company itself. It should be possible for contractors to report safety-related incidents to the mining company’s own safety database. It should also be possible to hand in observed risks and hazard manually through, e.g., specific “mail boxes” placed in and around the operations. Post-work evaluations should be performed of how health and safety issues have been handled by the contractors as well as by the mining company itself, including the communication and information sharing between the parties involved.

["understanding-and-improving-safety-culture.html", "8 Understanding, and improving, safety culture", " 8 Understanding, and improving, safety culture Magnus Safety work has evolved over time in the mining industry. During the 1980’s and 1990’s focus was to a significant extent put on technological solutions such as improved protection from hazards related to blasting and safer and more efficient machinery. New laws and regulations have also come into effect in the last decades that have led to more systematized risk management practices overall. Although technological solutions and the implementation of formal rules still play an important part, there has been a trend towards finding more novel organizational solutions for safety-related issues. One such solution is improving the safety culture within the companies. Safety culture can be defined as the “shared and learned meanings, experience and interpretations of work and safety – expressed partially symbolically – which guide peoples’ actions towards risks, accidents and prevention.” Richter &amp; Koch [1]. In practice, improving safety culture often involves a focus on encouraging safe behaviors. This includes the introduction of new procedures that are seen as facilitating certain types of behavioral practices. However, safety culture is a complex phenomenon that also involves interactions and exchanges among the workers themselves, i.e. safety culture emerges in a “bottom-up” fashion and may establish worker-specific norms and values that are outside of the direct control of management. The notion of safety culture being something that both management can improve and something that evolves naturally among the workers themselves is succinctly encapsulated in a model by Edwards et al [1] (figure 9.1). Edwards et al [1]. Safety outcomes can thus be seen as being dependent on three different “types” of culture that interact with each other in complex ways – or rather that three different perspectives can be taken on the nature and characteristics of culture. Normative culture highlights that specific structures, policies and procedures will make certain behavioral practices more likely to occur (i.e. pragmatic culture) that, in themselves, are affected by the beliefs, values and expectations of the workers (i.e. anthropological culture). However, while taking the interconnectedness of the three perspectives into account, it is clear that a dedicated focus by management on implementing appropriate structures, policies and procedures is a promising avenue for cultural change. One reason for this is that the formal structures and processes of an organization are under the direct control of management and, consequently, something that can be fairly easy to change – and that this eventually may have an effect on the meaning workers ascribe to safety. For example, Guldenmund [1] suggests that the safety management system of an organization may play an important part in creating meaningful safety practices for the workers by, e.g., making it clear what is expected of them in their daily work. Still, it is also important to consider how new initiatives will be perceived and interpreted by the workers given that culture, in the anthropological sense described above, can be seen as something “belonging” to the members of the organization themselves. If the suggested changes to policy and procedures are not in line with what the workers expect and need, there may be a resistance to change – or, put differently, a clash between cultures. Of course, some policies and procedures may be non-negotiable, for example wearing personal protective equipment and following safety rules, but it is important to reflect on the actual consequences that management-led initiatives will have from a cultural perspective. As seen, safety culture is a complex phenomenon and there are no easy solutions or implementation strategies. The literature, however, provides some additional considerations that mining companies can make when seeking to develop their culture: It is important to consider cultural issues in relation to other vital aspects of workplace safety, such as the current and future levels of technology development. Mining companies operate in conditions of intricate technical, physical and organizational relationships; everything is connected to each other and it is important to consider both “soft” (e.g. safety culture) and “hard” (e.g. technology development) perspectives on safety Lööw &amp; Nygren [1]. Cultural change may require several years, even decades, to come into effect Guldenmund [1], so management needs to take this into account when developing and implementing new structures and processes aimed at supporting the development of safety culture. If a mining company hires contractors, it is important to consider how the workers of these external companies can be integrated into the structures and processes of the mining company – and the level of integration that is appropriate given the formal division of responsibilities between different employers Lööw &amp; Nygren [1]. A reasonable start could be to synchronize the safety management systems of every company involved with that of the mining company. Cultural integration, in itself, may not be possible or even desirable due to the often short-term projects contractors are hired to perform. However, by introducing the workers to the context for safety work it can become clear what kind of meaning that should be placed on safety and that it is everyone’s responsibility to act accordingly.

["gender-and-gender-equality.html", "9 Gender and gender equality", " 9 Gender and gender equality Lisa Ringblom The mining industry is exceedingly male-dominated. Globally the workforce approximately consists of 90 per cent men, but with great variation depending on country, mineral and company. In the world’s top 500 listed mining companies only seven of these have a woman as CEO and about eight per cent of board representatives of these companies are women. Although mining has a significant history as work for and by men, this has not always been the case. A historical perspective on mining shows that the mine and its workplaces have not always been an arena solely for men. Depending on time and geographic location in history women have participated in all areas of the mining process. For example, in Sweden before the industrialization the number of women were at some mines as high as 55 per cent of the workforce. Due to the changes that came with the industrialization a statutory ban on women in underground work was implemented in 1900, a law that was repealed first 1978. The ban on women underground followed a more general ideological shift of societal norms that took place during industrialization, which affected the relationship between men and women. With the development of a stronger division between paid and unpaid work, a women’s place was first and foremost seen as the one as a wife and mother and women's salaried employment was predominantly seen as a complement to that of men. The exclusion of women in mining is not unique to Sweden, but is also found in other national contexts such as the United Kingdom, China and Peru. The reason for women's more or less temporary exclusion from mining work at different times in history has been legitimated with all from superstition (e.g. beliefs concerning misfortune with women underground) to national structural changes. The mining industry is not only male-dominated but is also characterized by masculinity. Traits that traditional have been labelled masculine, such as being strong, brave, tough etc. is still an ideal within mining. A “macho-masculinity” have to a large extent ruled structures, practices and procedures for the blue-collar working professional as well as professional ideals of mining. This type of macho-masculinity, associated with characteristics that are largely related to a physical body, such as practical knowledge, physical strength and endurance under stressful and risky working conditions, have connections to increased risk-taking, which in mining can have devastating outcome for organizations but primarily for the individual in terms of injuries and utterly death. Research on the link between gender and safety work in the mine has shown how the idealized macho-masculinity premise of risk taking poses a potential safety risk at work. These conservative ideas concerning gender can also be problematic during organizational and technological change and can create implementation problems and restoration responses. Because of the male-dominance and the idealized macho-masculinity mining organizations risk conflating gender with competence. Something that can function as an effective exclusion mechanism in these workplaces for those who are not perceived as fitting in to the norm of a “real” mineworker i.e. women. The historical exclusion of women from mining work, the dominant ideal of a macho -masculinity, and men's numerical dominance has created an opportunity for constructing women as deficient and deviant in relation to mining. This has contributed to the fact that women have not been able to participate in mining work under the same conditions as men and are expressed through, for example, stereotyping and sexualization of women. Sexism, sexual harassment and discrimination are recurring themes in women's working life in the mine. Even though men and macho-masculinity are dominating mining, when gender and gender equality is actualized in the mining industry it tends to focus on women. For example, when mining organization raises gender as an issue is it commonly the (often) low proportion of women that tends to be in focus. This is of course an important question in order to increase women’s participation in mining and to have the benefits of mining to be more equally distributed between men and women. But, only to focus on the number of women is not the entire solution for the male bias in the mining industry. Women should not only have the opportunity to get in, they should also want to stay in the industry. To increase gender awareness and to improve gender equality demands more from organizations than counting heads. This means that also more qualitative measures, which focus on the terms for men and women in the industry, need to be implemented. In other words, actions that challenges the unequal structures that do not necessarily change with an equal distribution of women and men. To have a gender perspective and to work for increased gender equality does not mean a solely focus on women, men are not to be left out from the equation. What is understood as work “appropriate” for men or women is not a law of nature - it is possible to change. So are also organizational cultures and the degree of diversity in the workforce. A long term responsibility and commitment towards a social sustainable development in mining needs to take gender issues into account in a broad range of ways, both concerning organizational issues as well as the gendered implications for the surrounding communities. Issues for women in the work environment in male-dominated organizations, is usually an indication that the work environment is not healthy for anyone. Even if women are especially exposed in a male-dominated workplace there are good reasons to believe that the work environment is problematic for all. Gender equality means that women and men have the same rights, responsibilities and opportunities in all areas of life. So, gender is not a women’s issue. Gender equality concerns both women and men. In a male-dominated industry as mining, to attract and recruit (more) women is an important step towards improved gender equality. But, to just focus on the number of women entering the industry is not enough. For example, women could be entering and leaving the industry within a short period of time which means that both in-flux and out-flux are important aspects. Most importantly however, is to analyze and examine the organizational terms and conditions for women and men within the organization. To increase gender equality in a sustainable and long- term way demands knowledge, time, resources and systematic work. At last, changing the question could lead to other solutions. Instead of asking why there are few women working within the mining industry, a maybe more interesting question would be – Why is there so many men? "],
["can-technology-improve-gender-equality-in-mining.html", "10 Can technology improve gender equality in mining?", " 10 Can technology improve gender equality in mining? Lisa Few professions have such an aura of masculine symbolism as mining work. The work in the mine has historically been characterized by heavy body work in a risky work environment. Notions concerning who is considered to be a “real” miner and what the work in the mine implies, is still today to a large extent story of a man that with his physical strength and practical skills masters the profession. This is nothe tablesince many of the workplaces in the mine today are considerable mechanized and digitalized and that women are part of the workforce. The work is in many ways characterized by both new and advanced technology and there is an accelerated pace of change in this area. This brings new work tasks, competence demands and new way of organizing mining work. As a result, mine work is changing due to technology development and this could potentially have an impact concerning gender equality. The technical development that has been evident in the mining sector during the last decades is often described as part of the explanation that has enabled women’s increased participation in the workforce, and the main reason that women now work in the mine to a greater extent than before. However, technology as an explanation for women’s increased participation in mining is somewhat puzzling. Historically, technology (its development and use) has to a large extent been linked to men and masculinity. Hence, male miners and the dominating ideal of a macho-masculinity has a somewhat different relation towards new technology in the workplace. Here, traditional tools and working methods with emphasis on manual labor is an important part of the professional identity as a miner. Historically, there has been a gender barrier of work in the mine as for and by men. Today, the boundary has been moved down in the mine and is rather between the mining work which has more manual elements and which is considered to be work primarily for men, and the work carried out using remote control, machines and automation and which is understood as for both men and women. This could partly explain the occurrence of mining men's distancing and resistance to new technology, and somewhat of a feminization of new technologies such as automation, digitization and robotization. There is a recurring story within the mining industry that women are particularly suited as machine operators. It is often said that women drive the machines more carefully, which leads to improved safety and lower maintenance costs. In an Australian context, there are examples of how new giant mining trucks and bulldozers weighing over 20 tons became \"women's machines\" and as a result, the miners who were men refused to drive them. This is an interesting aspect since heavy machinery in the world outside mining is not usually seen as suithe tablefor women but rather an area of men. New technology could be understood as challenging the traditional ideals of mining professionals. In a Swedish context there are for example research showing that when the first front loaders were moved from their machines underground to control the machines from the control center above ground, they still looked like miners and went to the dressing room as usual to change clothes before each shift, even though they were now working in a clean office environment. Miners underground, especially those who worked with more manual tasks, gave the remote controllers nicknames as \"velour workers\", called the control center the \"seventh heaven\" or in other ways clearly indicated that the remote controllers up at the control center were not \"real\" miners (even though they were men). After a while, this ritual ceased, but it indicates uncertainty in a new professional role and makes it clear that the step away from traditional underground mining was difficult to take. The increased proportion of women in mining work, is many times understood in relation to new machines and technical solutions that have created a better and safer working environment, which meant that certain tasks has become physically easier and thus also possible for women to perform. This explanation might be more ideological than real enabler since neither advanced technology nor a good working environment are necessarily indications for occupations or workplaces with a high proportion of women. Furthermore, if there is a link between automation and similar new technology and an increased proportion of women in these male-dominated workplaces, there is a certain lag. Admittedly, technology development in the mine may be said to have accelerated in recent years, but automated machinery and other technical equipment has existed for a considerable amount of time. The technical development in mining has been connected to the increased participation of women in mining during the last decade, since technological changes has improved the work environment and enabled women to participate due to the shift from manual to mechanized work. Even though the changes of mining work might have opened up for renegotiations concerning who can be a mine worker, technology is usually not the explanation for improved gender equality in work organizations in general. Technology, its development, implementation and use is an area that is commonly highly associated with men and masculinity and the tech-industry is an area of work that is highly male-dominated. This indicates that new male-dominated industry of digital technologies not necessarily will be the game changer concerning gender equality that the old male-dominated mining industry hopes for. The role of technology in mining and its relation to gender and gender equality could be both a window for change but could also in the long run reinforce mining as a male-dominated sphere. Therefore, the rapid technological development in the mine need to be closely monitored concerning its effect on gender equality and gender patterns within mining. When developing and implementing new technology – strive for inclusiveness of different perspectives and people along the entire chain. Who is regarded competent and why? "],

An important part of gender equality work is a situation assessment from a gender perspective, e.g. a gender analysis, meaning that facts are gathered, and that gender patterns are made visible and analyzed. Gender divided statistics is a necessary tool for gender analysis. Gender divided statistics enfolds not only statistics by sex, the statistics must aim at visualizing men and women’s conditions and needs at work and identifying problem areas. It is important to recognize both similarities and dissimilarities between men and women. A good way to start is to analyze issues of work division, task assignments, competence development, career paths to leadership positions, recruitment processes, sick leave, injuries, harassment cases, etc. – from a gender perspective. To perform an in depth gender analysis, quantitative and qualitative, with the aim of addressing norms, you need competence specializing in this field. If the groundwork is in place according to good knowledge about the organization and women and men’s condition, it is easier to introduce and implement new actions. 11.2 Objectives: With the basis of the given gender analysis, including a situation assessment and problem identification, it is now time to identify objectives – what you want to achieve (short term, long term, in numbers and/or other changes in the organization). A common mistake it to just formulate a general objective: increasing the number of women in the organization, gazing at numerical gender equality goals X % in policy documents. A good way to start is for example the SMART-tool. SMART goals is a tool used to formulate goals that are; Specific (clearly defined), Measurable (can be measured and followed up), Accepted (of all actors involved), Realistic and Relevant and Time-limited (a deadline is provided). Aim at identifying objectives in both quantitative and qualitative terms. 11.3 Planning: Good results require good preparation. To achieve the aim of improved gender equality, it is important that in the early stages think about organizational conditions and make plans on how to go about it. A good planning process is important in change management and in all gender equality initiatives as such. The project/initiative/action needs a: 1. Budget, 2. Schedule/timetable, 3. Accountability, who/m is responsible and for what. Allocating of resources (money, time, capacity) is an important steep to formalize the project and to prepare the organization for the upcoming action and change. Do not forget that change management and gender equality initiatives have costs! An important issue in the planning phase is also to determine if there is a need for expertise outside the organization. Do we need specialized competence for example process leaders or gender experts? 11.4 Action: When the situation is analyzed and problem areas are visualized, when objectives are clearly defined and the preparation and planning is set, it is time to take action. 11.5 Monitoring: Monitoring and documentation of the process is very important to get a picture about the progress but also to pinpoint if the project is going in the wrong direction. If the set up is successful you can use the same systematics over an oven again. Another gain is that the knowledge and learning process is not connected to the process leader, project manager or its participants. 11.6 Evaluation: In all projects and in development work it is important to evaluate and follow-up the outcome, and actions for gender equality are no exception. To ask for results and evaluate the measures implemented is also a way to visualize that gender issues are a priority and important an important issue for the organization. Evaluation must be made of the result/outcome in relation to project specific objectives, preferably both in quantitative- and qualitative terms. But also evaluation of the process as a whole, what can we take with us to the next cycle?

The model focuses the work as a process, as a circular movement for learning and continuous improvements. The first step of the model for working for improved gender equality is analysis which focuses situation assessment and collecting data about the current situation, an important aspect of all change processes within organizations as a basis for a new practice. After that the model take on objectives, planning, actions, monitoring of the activities and at last and importantly evaluation of the process and its results to take on to the next cycle.

Industry 4.0 is described as the next great industrial revolution. After the steam engine, electricity and electronics, the revolution consists of an implementation of “Internet of Things, Humans and Services” where the entire production process is included in internet-based networks that transform ordinary factories to smart factories (Kagerman et al 2013). Similar concepts have appeared all over the world. The Chinese government promotes a similar idea under the name Made in China [1], the the Japanese government has launched Society 5.0 and the Swedich government use the term Smart Industry. Meanwhile the German vision paints a bright picture of the future industry in which virtual and physical worlds will be linked into a powerful ‘whole’ through the integration of software – from product development and production, machines will not just do ‘physical work’ but also perform calculations. This is described as cyber-physical systems, or even socio-cyber-physical systems: smart ventilation, smart logistics, smart maintenance, smart machines and other smart systems continuously exchange information with themselves and with human workers. The German strategy highlights the potential for skill development and a richer working life with more challenging work tasks. 13.3 Mining 4.0 Industry 4.0 will also come to affect the mining industry. In fact, some mines have taken important steps towards the digitalized mine of the future. Gradually, the mining industry gets closer to the visions of Industry 4.0 and fully automated mines as well as more technologically sophisticated ore processing facilities. Analogous to the application of Industry 4.0 in a mining context, we conceptualize Mining 4.0 as a mining operation where the miner is an expert who ensures that production runs smoothly. A Mining 4.0 operator is not confined to a control room. Instead, real-time process data and the status of machines follow the miner as they move around the mine. The miner solves problems on the spot by remotely interacting with other operators, experts, suppliers and customers in multi-competent teams. Production control could even be done in a digital model (or “digital twin”) far away from the factory. In short, Mining 4.0 envisions an augmented miner with senses and memory extended through technology. This technology takes advantage of and supports human skills and increases situational awareness through sensors embedded in the clothes of operator, for example, while keeping an uninterrupted operational vigilance. Romero et al [1] formed a typology of the future Industry 4.0 operator: Operator 4.0. It built on eight characteristics that can be seen as the core of the new technology; we have modified them to relate to the future miner: Strengthened operator – Powered industrial exoskeletons assists with heavy loads and lifts, while also mitigating vibrations. This helps operators avoid musculoskeletal disorders from unergonomic work. In future mines, while much of the work will be done remotely, exoskeletons can be useful during manual work tasks, such as maintenance work and manual drilling. A common optimistic hope is that this opens up for women. This technology doesn’t come without drawbacks, however. Industries could start using exoskeleton technology to mitigate health problems from work tasks rather than addressing and solving the issues that cause the problems in the first place. Augmented operator – Augmented reality glasses allows for overlaying digital information onto the real world. It has many possible uses in the mining industry that would help provide and translate information for the operators while out working. This includes having work instructions show the operators what they need to interact with and when, navigational aid within mines and displaying machine information such as fuel levels. Virtual operator – VR technology provides interactive 3D visualizations, for example allowing operators to train and interact with a virtual machine before working with a physical one. In the mining industry, VR technology could simulate sitting inside the cabin of a machine through cameras while the operator would in reality be sitting in a remote control room, allowing for more accurate remote control. It also allows for training simulations to become more realistic or engaging. The combination of VR technology and remote controlled machines could, however, lead to outsourcing parts of production control to low-wage countries becoming a more viable and attractive prospect. Healthy operator – Tracking of operators’ health values and position to notify them of danger, identify injured people and locating them. This can help locate people and provide vital information if an accident, such as a cave-in, were to occur in the mine. The technology can also be used to better monitor and organise the operators in the mine. For example, operators can be guided based on monitoring data to travel through safer paths with less traffic, which will make navigating the mine safer and more efficient. At the same time, one must be aware that these systems are a threat against personal integrity and must be handled with care. The technology could be used to control workers rather than the process. In a safety critical situation this type of human tracking might be welcomed, but the information could also be misused. Smarter operator – Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPA) will, through voice interaction technology, allow for operator to more easily interface with machines and digital systems. For example, an operator would be able to vocally ask the IPA where certain vehicles are, and the IPA would map out a route. For a mining operator, an IPA could make it easier to access and managing information while out working or performing maintenance. They could also be used to control semi-autonomous machines vocally, for example by asking a drill to drive to a specific part of the mine. Collaborative operator – Advancements in industrial robot technology would allow for robots more capable of avoiding collision with any nearby people or objects. This would allow operators to work side-by-side with industrial robots and will help make tunnels, where mining vehicles travel, safer for the employees. The optimistic perspective for this technology sees that the robots take over the dangerous, unergonomic and/or tedious work tasks, letting the employees focus on interesting and safe work tasks. In a pessimistic perspective, robots and technology take over all jobs, essentially replacing the people with machines. The fear of this occurring must be taken into account when implementing the technology so as to not cause worry and incite resistance from the employees. Social operator – The utilization and implementation of social networking technology in the organisation would allow for better communication possibilities between operators and machines. This also allows for more opportunities for informal knowledge sharing between operators. With the development and implementation of 5G-networks in mining industries, operators and machines can utilize high-speed connections to communicate even from below ground. The greater capabilities to stay connected could, however, lead to a thinning of the lines between work and spare time due to employees being more readily available at all times. Analytical operator – With more data being gathered from machines and systems, operators can better understand their performance and status. In addition, the increased amount and types of information allows for better forecasts of system and machine performance. This allows for better scheduling of more types of maintenance work. The increased data flow can also come to affect the mining operators in that their work tasks could be focused more on optimization and development. This classification points to the numerous possibilities of integrating Industry 4.0 with human labour – some good and some bad. But this development is not about creating new kinds of jobs. Rather it is a development that means that most current jobs will be influenced by these characteristics and developments. Miners will not disappear, but they will be different in the future.

["mining-4-0-utopia-or-dystopia.html", "14 Mining 4.0 - Utopia or Dystopia", " 14 Mining 4.0 - Utopia or Dystopia Joel Lööw, Lena Abrahamsson and Jan Johansson In previous chapters, we have described various development opportunities for future mining work. Here we will try to summarize our experiences in two extremes, a negative dystopian development and a positive utopian. The two visions are read and illustrated on www.xxxvv. The chapter concludes with six recommendations on how to start shaping the future of Mining 4.0 on human terms How will Mining 4.0 affect tomorrow's mining work? There is no clear answer to that question. There is no inherent technological determinism in the development; it will depend on the choices that we make. It's up to us. The dystopian scenario gives this miserable picture: You have to be grateful that you even have a job. Most of the jobs have disappeared, and the entire municipality is depopulated. There are some qualified jobs located in the control center above ground, but most of these jobs have moved to town and are carried out remotely via the net. Some work is even done from India. It's not just an A and B team anymore; we now also have a C team. What remains is mostly maintenance work. We are wearing augmented-reality glasses and carrying out tasks according to the instructions that we get from central maintenance or a machine supplier. Sometimes we have to put on an exo-skeleton if there is heavy lifting. But everything is not bad. The work is not as dangerous as before, because we do not work at the front nowadays, and there are no diesel vehicles anymore. Underground everything is automated, but of course we must install the electricity and access points, and then you notice that the company has reduced the ventilation. The blasting gases still remain far into the shift and you can feel your heading getting heavier as the day drags on. What I miss most is my workmates; we have our mobile phones and tablets so that we can keep in touch with each other, but it is not the same as when working with the boys. The utopian vision becomes much more pleasant to accept: Most of the underground work is automated and no one works near the front anymore. The production control takes place from a bright and pleasant control room above ground. The routine monitoring work has been automated; with AI you get a better stability in production. Our professional role has been extended to include the entire value flow, from mountain to customer. If we see an opportunity for improvement, we can switch over to our digital twin to experiment and test the outcome.It is always fun if you can trim the production; and then not only financial measures apply, but also so-called green measures, such as saving water or reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We are quite proud that our company takes a great social responsibility, not only for the environment but for a prosperous society that can offer a rich social and cultural environment. When something goes wrong in the production, it is indicated in our mobile phones and usually we can solve it with a few keystrokes. But sometimes we have to go into a VR model and maybe direct a robot to a crusher to break apart a boulder. If the error has not occurred before, we sometimes have to go down into the mine to understand what has happened. When we are forced to go down into the mine, we always wear a safety vest with sensors so that one can follow where we are and warn if any dangerous environmental factors appears, or if something seems strange to our health. Last month my daughter even started working for the company. She is a computer science major but works as much with my colleagues as she does with a computer. For a long time, I thought I would be the last miner in the family. It feels good to know that there will be a new generation, and that young people have stopped moving away. It seems the company’s investments in the community, and insistence on training and using locals, really payed off. The scenarios are exaggerated but probable. Mining 4.0 can definitely represent a positive development, but there are many questions that must be cleared. Based on our experiences and and previous research, we want to bring forward six recommendations that can be considered as a beginning of a road map for developing Mining 4.0 on human terms: We need more ways of measuring success, ways that capture social factors. Any reduction in the workforce must be managed with great transparency and in close cooperation with the trade unions. All employees must be included in competence development; leave nobody behind. Create a flat organization that empowers employees and encourages their creativity. Handle privacy and integrity issues in close cooperation with the trade unions and workers. Embed all changes in a context of great social responsibility It is important that the mining industry is active in creating Mining 4.0, but we also know that it will take time and there will be many obstacles along the way. To succeed we must be vigilant and attentive to all aspect of modern mining – future as well as past. "],

The purpose of this chapter is to give a brief overview of theories/models that are important for understanding which factors affect the acceptance of new technologies. Organizations in the modern industrialized world face a rapidly evolving environment that requires changes to be able to keep up with the requirements, and the mining industry is no exception. First we need to state that the human is generally skeptical about change, there is a fear of the unknown. Change can be perceived as stressful which leads to negative emotions and feelings of uncertainty which in turn can affect acceptance. There is of course variation in how well individuals embrace and accept change. Though, for technologies to be useful, they must be accepted and used by the employees in the organization Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, &amp; Davis [1]. Therefore, when introducing new technology there are several aspects that need to be considered to gain acceptance and succeed with the implementation. We will now give a brief overview of the most prominent theories in this area. 15.1 The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) The Theory of planned behavior (TPB), developed by Ajzen and Fishbein [1]read in….), assumes that the decision to engage in a particular behavior is the result of a rational process. This means that humans take different behavioral options into consideration and then evaluate the different possible outcomes, and after that decide to behave in one way or another. The decision will lead to an intention to perform the chosen behavior. Intentions is suggested to be a good predictor of actual behavior,  https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/\\_-Hqyha0rvzpyPyYtojs34nbcmARtgfMiFxbaFmqrGziNgSF58pKq1FSqMAkmoTMyYtljGA35nhiywedg43rVb-E-uNyIHTeM53spK56biy5t4QhMEbdO9kBD9Zp-9NC8ZBz8iXn Figure x.x. Skapa en egen bild 15.2 The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) Technology is accepted when it is perceived as useful and easy to use. System design also affects user acceptance. In a study by Davis [1], perceived usefulness was found 50 % more important for user acceptance than ease of use. That means, it is important to design based on user needs. Davis (exemplifies what is meant by perceived usefulness: the system is perceived to improve quality of work, gives greater control, enables the worker to accomplish tasks faster, supports critical aspects of work (i.e. decision mak-ing or monitoring), increases productivity, improves job performance, enhances effectiveness, and makes it easier to do the job. If a technology solution does not clearly show high usefulness by the user the user may be reluctant to use it. A system that is designed to control workers has high usefulness for management personnel but not necessarily for the workers. Highly effective workers may be positive to a control system since they may profit from their effectiveness being measured and observed. A control system may also be perceived as useful if its purpose is related to increased personal safety. Acceptance will be low if the workers do not see any benefits coming from the system. 15.3 Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) There are many models that attempt to determine what factors that affect information technology acceptance among the users. Based on eight such prominent models, including previously described TPB and TAM, Venkatesh, Morris, Davis and Davis [1] presents a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The model has been found to explain 70% of the variance in user intention Venkatesh et al [1] and 50% in technology use Venkatesh, Thong, &amp; Xu [1].  According to UTAUT, four constructs are direct determinants of user acceptance and usage behavior, namely; performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions (Figure X.X). Below the four constructs are briefly described.   The construct performance expectancy is defined, by Venkatesh and colleagues [1], as the degree to which an individual believes that using the system will help him or her to attain gains in job performance. It is suggested to be the strongest predictor of behavioral intention to use and accept the technology (e.g. Zuiderwijk, Janssen, &amp; Dwivedi [1].  This implies that it is of great importance to make the usefulness of the new technology visible for the workers.  The second construct, effort expectancy, is defined as the degree of ease associated with the use of the system Venkatesh et al [1]. This means that although the users believe the technology to be useful, it will not be accepted unless they also believe the technology to be easy to use.  It is therefore important to build and design technology on human terms. It may seem obvious that a technology should be useful and both efficient and effective to use. However, there are often several needs that are missed in the process. Some specific demands for operators in the mining industry that are important to consider when investing in usable technology is presented in Chapter x (Technology on human terms in a mining context). Third, social influence is defined as the degree to which an individual perceives that important others believe he or she should use the system Venkatesh et al [1]. The opinions of colleagues, managers, supervisors, family and friends may therefore be salient when an individual user is forming an intention to use new technology. This is especially true in mandatory settings, i.e. when using the technology is not optional (e.g. Venkatesh et al [1]. The influence of others' opinions tends to be highest in the early stages of experience with the technique, before the individual has had time to form their own opinion.  This implies that it is important to view the implementation of new technology as a group process and therefore also handle it on a group level. Further, it is also extremely important to remember that workers are influenced by the management and therefore, managers must communicate support and believe in the system. This means that acceptance of the technology must permeate the entire organization. The fourth construct, facilitating conditions, are defined as the degree to which an individual believes that an organizational and technical infrastructure exists to support the use of the system Venkatesh et al [1]. This construct includes things such as the need for users to feel that they have the resources and knowledge necessary to use the system and that it is supported by the organization. There must also be possible to get help if difficulties with using the technique would arise.  The model suggests the first three constructs to influence behavioural intention to use a technology, while the fourth is a direct determinant of user behavior (see Figure X.X).  The UTAUT also consists of four moderating factors which are gender, age, experience and voluntariness of use (see Figure X.X). These moderators are expected to affect the relationship between the constructs and the intention to accept/use the technology. For example, performance expectancy has been found to be more salient for men and younger workers, while the opposite is found for effort expectancy. Further, women are suggested to be more sensitive (than men) for others’ opinions when forming an intention to use new technology, however the effect is declining with experience.  The complex interactions for gender and age is something to consider for being able to create equithe tableworkplace environments for women and men of all ages Venkatesh et al [1].  https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/m3c4WbM4v4P5RMvLihYL-HRFIglDi2bPrmBMNOyaB0oF6rTiYvy6EU2wDTPf4HA4AsVz6NQ6BJzyebv7b0KRD258\\_iO9wHJLZjDOrIOkLSp78O9DwT6\\_ka5HIq8QXZUncxFlY4Tj Figure X.X The variables and moderators in the UTAUT model. Denna är tagen rakt av från internet så vi behöver göra om den... Since this model was introduced it has been used extensively by researchers when trying to explain the acceptance and use of technology. Although the model has been successful, newer research has found that these constructs and moderators are not always applicable to all contexts, and some crucial constructs may be excluded Dwivedi, Rana, Jeyaraj, Clement, &amp; Williams [1]. Many studies have not utilized the moderating factors Venkatesh et al [1], and one explanation might be that there may not be any variation in the moderators Dwivedi et al [1]. As an example, the organization might have decided that the use of the technology is mandatory, which makes the moderator voluntariness not applicable. Dwivedi and colleagues [1] further argue that the UTAUT model is missing out one important aspect, namely the individual perspective. Attitudes, an individual’s positive or negative feelings about performing the target behavior, play an important role in accepting technology. They found that attitude had a central role in an individual’s intention to use the technology and that it also had a direct effect on usage behavior. Therefore, it is proposed that attitude should be an integral part of the UTAUT model in the future.  After a review of the UTAUT model the moderating factors have been merged to user attributes, which means that they can be expanded to include other demographic variables Venkatesh, Thong, &amp; Xu [1], which variables depend on the specific situation.  How to sum up? 15.4 Beers theory of organizational change  Implementing new technology also often means an organizational change. Unfortunately, around 70% of initiated changes though fail (e.g., Burnes [1]. It is therefore of great value to have an effective approach for organizational change. A rational approach to change is Beer’s theory of organizational change Beer [1]read in Hughes, Ginnett, &amp; Curphy [1]. This model includes many of the issues raised by other researchers in the field and highlights what is important for leaders in organizations to consider if they want to be successful with their change effort. The model can be used as a road map when wanting to implement an organizational change, as well as a diagnostic tool to find out what went wrong if an investment failed to meet its promises.  Beer has proposed a formula: C = D x M x P &gt; R   Figure X.X. Beer’s formula for organizational change 15.4.1 C stands for the amount of change that is achieved, and of course “the higher the better”. The amount is though depending on the levels of the other factors in the formula which needs to be considered for being successful with the change. These factors are briefly described below and exemplified with introducing new technology in a mining context. The D in the formula stands for the employees’ dissatisfaction with the current situation. How satisfied the employees are with the current situation is an important factor when trying to accomplish change, because satisfied employees are much less willing to change. This means that if the employees are satisfied, a key factor for change is to increase dissatisfaction (though, up to the point that the employees are willing to take action but not too much so that they leave the organization). Let’s exemplify, if the organization is about to introduce new technology, then it might be a good idea to first determine how satisfied the employees are with the current situation and/or present technology. If they are satisfied, but the organization though sees the need for new technology, then it is necessary to increase dissatisfaction. This can be done by talking about economic, competitive, legal, technological and social challenges that the organization stands in front and what can happen if not implementing the change (e.g., dismissal of personnel, bankruptcy, or safety risks).  The M stands for the model for change which foremost constitutes of a clear vision for the change and goals that the change is trying to accomplish. The vision should provide guidance for the organization’s action, what needs to be changed to fulfill the vision and accomplish the goals. To exemplify; the vision could be to be the most attractive mining company in Sweden. In order to reach that vision, a set of goals need to be established. One goal can for example be: increase safety. After setting up the goals, it must be decided which systems that need to change in order to fulfill the vision and accomplish the goals. For example, in order to reach the goal to increase safety the organization might decide to implement new technology such as positioning technology. Though, in order to be successful, one needs to think about how changes in one system can affect other parts of the organization. For example, if the goal to increase safety includes implementing positioning technology, employees' reaction to that needs to be considered (see chapter x). Hence, to be successful one must consider how changes in one system can lead to consequences for other parts of the organization. The P symbolizes the process which consists of the development and execution of the change plan. A change plan should answer the questions what, who, when, where and how the change will happen. It might also include planned actions for how to handle possible resistance and increase dissatisfaction if necessary. A thorough communication plan is also needed as it is important that all parties are well informed throughout the process. A good way to get the employees committed to the change plan is to let those who are affected by the change to create the plan. Of course, that is not always possible and in that case it is suggested that commitment to the plan can be increased if the personal benefits of the change is made clear, the expectations are explicitly stated, and if there is a trusting relationship between the employees and the leaders Hughes et al [1]. In the case of implementing positioning technology, the model suggests that it might be a good idea to let the employees be involved in an early stage to ensure commitment (see also Chapter xx).  At least have the chance to decide how the information should be handled.   15.4.2 R stands for resistance. As already mentioned, people often resist change which can partly depend on fear of the unknown and a fear of loss. The employees might fear that the change will result in loss of identity, close relationships with others, loss of power, or fear of being seen as incompetent. Resistance can also stem from a temporary drop in performance which is very common when employees learn new systems and skills. These types of sources for resistance should be taken into account in the change plan.  In the case with implementing positioning technology that handles personal information, there might be a fear of violation of privacy and misuse of information (see Chapter xx). One way to handle such fear is to listen to possible concerns and let the employees be part of the change plan. To sum up, this model suggests that it is possible for the organization to increase the amount of change by considering different aspects. The level of change can be increased by increasing the level of dissatisfaction with the current situation, present a clear vision, develop a well-thought-out plan for the change, or by decreasing the employees level of resistance. Though, as you can see in Figure x.x, the model is multiplicative which means that none of the factors can be 0 if change is about to occur. For example, it doesn’t matter how well thought-out the change plan is or how clear the vision is if there is no dissatisfaction with the current situation. Or on the other hand, if there is dissatisfaction with the current situation but there is no plan, then it will result in little change.  15.4.3 Individual factors 15.5 Trust Many barriers for acceptance of change can be structured under trust. Trust in management is a good predictor of lower level of resistance to change. If however the organization doesn’t have, or has lost, the employees trust, then resistance will be higher and change will be more difficult to achieve.  This section will be expanded. (read Conte &amp; Landy [1]; Korunka &amp; Hoonakker [1] 15.6 Perception of fairness It has been well-established that fairness plays a key role in determining reactions to organizational events such as EPM (electronic performance monitoring).

["positioning-technology-safety-vs-privacy-concerns.html", "16 Positioning technology - safety vs privacy concerns 16.1 Important psychological aspects to consider", " 16 Positioning technology - safety vs privacy concerns Camilla och Lisa This chapter discusses the positive effects of positioning technology from a safety perspective and sets it against privacy concerns. Factors that need to be considered to enhance privacy and reduce the perception of misuse are discussed. As can be read in Chapter 2, a recommendation for creating attractive workplaces in the mining industry is to have health and safety at work as a top priority. This can be achieved through mechanization, remote control and automation, as well as a developed safety climate. An additional way to increase safety is to use new and advanced communication and positioning technology that works in a mining environment. The communication and positioning technology allows real-time location, tracking and monitoring of vehicles, personnel and equipment. The information can be available both in control rooms on the surface and underground on mobile phones and tablets (see Figure 8.1). Such technology entails everybody, wherever they are located, information about what is going on down below (and above ground).  https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7Q6W4mViw0vety8qFGTzThatuRbFv3MSb4u4qZjwCM4pOHWhZhE\\_zwGh-U69c453Go11euU7ivYLxAe5fTmd5VKPZoSHsmjU7pWwH1amPNttKiL88LwiB1UfQrlarw Figure 8.1. The picture shows a possible map view in a mobile phone/the tableand in a control room. From a safety perspective, it is of course a great advantage to see peoples’ exact location, for example, in case of a fire or a cave-in that requires evacuation of the mine. In such situations, time is of great importance. Without positioning technology, the rescue personnel need to spend a lot of time on getting confirmation about each worker that they are in a safe location. With a positioning system, this phase goes much faster and instead focus can be on those who have not reached safety and take decisions about who needs attention first.  Today's technology makes it possible to also collect other types of information from the environment as well as from humans. Via sensors, information regarding machine functionality, temperature, tensions, vibrations and similar can be collected, as well as information of the surrounding environment such levels of fumes and gases in the air. A rather new concept is sensors worn by humans, measuring human conditions. Physiological sensors can provide information about personal health such as pulse and temperature; biokinetic sensors can measure posture and body movements (position); and ambient sensors can measure environmental factors such as temperature och sound pressure level Johny &amp; Anpalagan [1]; Figure 8.2). These systems could also be useful as a preventive safety system or in case of an accident as the information can be shared with other workers close by, control room personnel, and rescue personnel.  https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LRbJfzcukbHnm0CsCyhMvw8q3qLcmz2hOnRfvECkBrpE4eIWINsokVPtn9Vi7aLRR22xhvK9pVY5Pa1cW9PXeqbVuAZ-wkN86NiK1TR-jy354sUP4pr11yIHXn5JPg Figure 8.2. Information that is possible to collect by positioning technology and wearable sensors. The picture of the process operator is borrowed from Boliden. Doubtlessly, this is a great advantage - but what do the workers think about such technology? In a safety critical situation this type of human tracking might be accepted by the workers, but the information could also be misused. As can be read in Chapter 6, one must be aware that these kinds of systems are a threat against personal integrity and must therefore be handled with care. According to Zweig and Webster [1] there is a growing acknowledgment that technologies that track presence and activity lead to privacy concerns. Hence, when implementing such technology, psychological aspects must be taken under consideration. 16.1 Important psychological aspects to consider Privacy is defined as the extent to which individuals believe they have control over their personal information and interactions with others Stone &amp; Stone [1]. If the individual perceives a loss of such control it can lead to a perception of invasion of privacy. Privacy concerns are one of the most consistent reactions to awareness systems (e.g. Zweig &amp; Webster [1]. Hence, positioning technology and human sensors can lead to the feeling of lost control if not restricted and handled properly. Based on research and findings in the SIMS-project and other related projects, we will now briefly exemplify eight psychological aspects that are important to consider in order to avoid violating privacy and to create acceptance for technique that collects personal data.    First, the collected information must be perceived as being relevant, i.e. necessary and appropriate to collect. Collected information that is perceived as relevant are more likely to be viewed as less invasive of privacy than information that is perceived as irrelevant (e.g. Alge [1]. It is therefore extremely important that each bit of information that is collected can be justified on good grounds. Have in mind, even though today's technology makes it possible to collect all sorts of information, information should not only be collected because it is possible. The more the merrier does not apply in this context. For example, if one's position is of importance only from a safety perspective, then it may be of less importance to view the name of Second, it is of great importance to make the usefulness of the technology visible for the workers to achieve acceptance (e.g. Davis [1]. The organization must be able to communicate why such systems should be implemented. Like when children ask “why”, “because” is not a good answer. Are you satisfied with such an answer? Hence, the organization must be able to justify the use, have a legitimate reason for implementing the system. From a privacy perspective, the individual wants to have control over what information the organization has access to, and how the organization will use the collected information Brandimartie, Acquisti, &amp; Loewenstein [1]. Most important for accepting to reveal personal information is likely to be in control over how the information will be used. In this context, be careful to ensure and clarify the purposes for collecting possibly sensitive information and to communicate the true purpose. It is also important to explain the usefulness clearly. For example, make sure that the workers understand how the technology will enhance their safety and facilitate rescue operations. A further aspect is to emphasize the accompanying advantages such technology can have for the workers in their everyday job, in terms of being able to locate persons, vehicles and equipment, as well as providing information about the surrounding environment.  Third, participation is a key component for enhancing employees' perception of procedural justice and reduce feelings of invasion of privacy Alge [1]. It is therefore important to allow employees to be involved in both the design and implementation of the technology. The workers should be involved at an early stage, even if introducing the technology is mandatory, i.e. not optional. They should be included when discussing and deciding what information should be collected, who will have access to the information, how the information should be stored and handled etc. For example, knowledge of who is able to monitor you has been found to lower perceptions of privacy invasion Zweig &amp; Webster [1]. One further advantage with including workers early in the process is the possibility to understand the hopes and fears. It is important to be responsive to any concerns that employees might have and try to sort them out at an early stage. Therefore, the most skeptical employees can be a valuable resource. If their concerns are listened to and met, there is a greater possibility that the technology will be accepted when implemented.  Fourth, our attitudes are influenced by important others, and attitudes toward positioning technology is no exception. That means that an individual worker's attitude to such technology can be influenced by the attitudes of the colleagues (social influence). This is especially true in mandatory settings, i.e. when using the technology is not optional (e.g. Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, &amp; Davis [1]. The influence of others' opinions tends to be highest in the early stages of experience with the technique, before the individual has had time to form their own opinion. Each worker's individual a priori attitude about the technology cannot simply be summed up to predict whether the group will decide to adopt the technology or not, unless they all are in agreement Sarker, Valacich, &amp; Sarker [1]. If not in agreement, a complex group interaction process will start, where they attempt to influence each other, which in turn results in the group adopting or not the technology. This implies that it is important to view the implementation of new technology as a group process and therefore also handle it on a group level. Further, it is also extremely important to remember that workers also are influenced by the management and therefore, managers must communicate support and believe in the system. This means that acceptance of the technology must permeate the entire organization. Fifth, the human strives for the perception of justice. Therefore, to achieve acceptance for positioning technology it may be of importance that everybody can see everybody's position. If a worker is monitored differently than other coworkers or other professionals, that worker may experience injustice Alge [1]. The feeling of big brother’s watching you should be avoided. It has also been found that mere suspicion that the information could be used for performance monitoring creates perception of unfairness Zweig &amp; Webster [1]. Hence, if there is no such intention with the system, it is important to make that clear.   Sixth, another important factor that can affect acceptance for technical systems that collect personal information is trust. Such systems require a level of trust in the relationships between colleagues, managers and the organization. Trust in this context means, the belief that the other party (who collects the data) will behave in a responsible manner and by doing so also fulfill the trusting party’s (the employees) expectations without taking advantage of its vulnerabilities Pavlou [1]. Hence, the employees must feel trust in that the people who have access to the information will handle it with care and not misuse it. When interviewing workers who have experience with positioning technology trust is the most frequently mentioned aspect for accepting the technology.  Seven, the implementation of new technology requires proper training. A lot of money is spent on developing new technology but much less is spent on educating the personnel who will use it how to use the technology. This is a step that is often forgotten. It can be summarized as “too little training and too late”. As an example, in the event of an accident it is not desirable for the personnel in the dispatch center to see the emergency functions for the first time. Further, another side of trust besides trust in relationships (see aspect sixth) is overtrust in technology. What happens if the system goes down because of a power failure and the position technology can’t be used? Then it is important to have a back up plan and have had proper training on how to handle such situations with manual routines. Eight, the human is generally skeptical about change, there is a fear of the unknown. Change can be perceived as stressful which leads to negative emotions and feelings of uncertainty which in turn can affect acceptance. This can be countered with thorough information. Therefore, it is extremely important to keep the personnel updated, at all stages in the implementation of positioning technology, and make sure that all personnel receive the same information (due to creating justice).  There are of course other important aspects to consider but the purpose with this chapter was to highlight some of the most important psychological aspects that need to be considered when implementing technology that handles personal information. Below the aspects are summarized in a bullet list:  Make sure that the system only collects relevant information  Make sure that the usefulness of the system is visible for the individual workers Make it clear what the purpose with the system is and what it is not (e.g. not performance monitoring) Design and implement the technology in close cooperation with the workers Consider changes as a group process (social influence) Make sure that acceptance permeates the entire organization Make sure that the technology is used in a fair way and create guidelines that restrict the use of the system and which include individual rights, how the information will be stored, who will have access to what information and so forth.  Make sure that trust exist in the organization Make sure that the users get proper training Give the workers thorough information and make sure that there are forums to vent questions about expectations and fears with the technology  References "],

These questions are meant to aid the organization in the process towards technology that are effective, efficient and accepted from a user perspective. The guideline can also be used as a diagnostic tool to find out what went wrong if an investment fails to meet its promises.  Although the intention (often) is good when introducing new technology in an organization, there is no guarantee that the intended users will accept and use the technology. Further, even though the technology is “right,” people might not accept it Zweig &amp; Webster [1]. Hence, the technology must be complemented with human factors/social factors/psychological barriers… The best way to achieve a successful implementation of new technology is of course to proactively avoid making mistakes that can be thought of beforehand.  Based on research introduced in previous chapters (see for example chapter x and x) and on our experiences from the SIMS project and other similar projects, we have created a guideline consisting of questions that are good to consider before implementing new technology in order to attain acceptance. The questions are organized around the different aspects that they are supposed to consider.   Clear vision  What is the purpose of implementing the new technology? What are the goals with the new technology? Is the purpose and goals clear for the employees? Can the new technology have consequences for other parts of the organization? Of course, the purpose for implementing new technology should be known and well thought-out, however a clear vision and intended goals should be formulated Beer [1]read in Hughes, Ginnett, &amp; Curphy [1]. The vision and goals must also be communicated to all employees that are affected by the new technology. Hence, the organization must be able to justify and give a legitimate reason for why implementing the technology. One also needs to think about how changes in one system can affect other parts of the organization.  Perceived usefulness (Performance expectancy) Will the new technology make it easier to do a good job? Will the new technology make it easier to accomplish tasks more quickly? Will the new technology improve safety at work? Overall, is the technology perceived as useful? The purpose for implementing new technology may of course vary, however it is important to make sure that the workers see the usefulness with the technology to attain acceptance (e.g., Davis [1]; Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, &amp; Davis [1].  Perceived ease of use (Effort expectancy) Is the new technology easy to learn and remember how to use? Is the new technology easy to understand and interact with? Is the new technology flexible and possible to use for all workers? Overall, is the new technology perceived as easy to use? As mentioned, it is not enough that the users believe the technology to be useful, it will not be accepted unless they also believe the technology to be easy to use (e.g., Davis [1]; Venkatesh et al [1]. The technology should therefore have been developed on human terms... Inclusiveness Can the new technology be used independent of size and strength? Can the new technology be used independent of age? As an extension of usefulness, it is extremely important to take into account that people differ and the technology must therefore be inclusive, i.e. suited for all workers, despite gender, age, height etc.  Facilitating conditions Will the users have the resources necessary to use the system? Will the users have the competence/knowledge needed to use the technology? Will the users get appropriate support if they do not know how to use the technology? Will the users get appropriate support if the technology fails to work? Is the technology compatible with other technologies or systems used at the workplace? Organizations can spend a lot of money on developing and implementing new technology but much less is spent on educating the personnel who will use it how to use the technology. It is therefore important to consider these types of questions, at an early stage, and make sure that an organizational and technical infrastructure exists to support use of the new technology (e.g., Venkatesh et al [1]. Participation Can the employees be involved in the decision to implement the new technology? If not, can the employees be involved in the implementation? Are there forums for the employees to raise questions about the new technology? A good way to get the employees to accept changes in the organization is to let those who are affected by the change to be part in the process (e.g., Beer [1]read in Hughes et al [1]. Of course, it is not always possible for the employees to be involved in the decision, though they might be able to influence certain aspects within given frames.  Social influence  Are the user groups/employees positive towards using new technology? Are the user groups/employees positive towards changes at work? Is the implementation supported by the managers in the organization? The opinions of colleagues, managers, supervisors, family and friends are important when an individual user is forming an intention to use new technology. This is especially true in mandatory settings, i.e. when using the technology is not optional (e.g. Venkatesh et al [1]. The influence of others' opinions tends to be highest in the early stages of experience with the technique, before the individual has had time to form their own opinion. Also, workers are influenced by the management and therefore, managers must communicate support and believe in the system. This means that acceptance of the technology must permeate the entire organization. Implementation plan Is there a clear plan that clarifies who, what, when, where and how the implementation of the technology should take place? Is the plan communicated to everybody in the organization? A thorough plan increases the chances of a successful implementation. The plan should for example include timelines, key deliverables, and who is responsible for what Beer [1]read in Hughes et al [1]. Because employees that are satisfied with the current situation are less willing to change and because people often resist change, it might be a good idea to also include planned actions for how to handle possible resistance and increase dissatisfaction if necessary. It is also important to make sure that the plan is communicated to all affected parties in the organization.  Perceived justice Can an uneven access to technology and information be justified? Is the use of information provided by the technology restricted? How the information is used is clearly described Voluntariness of use The technology is not compulsory to use, there are other ways. The technology is compulsory to use. Privacy concerns (Intrusiveness) Is there any risk that the new technology can be intrusive? Perceived need for change The pre-existing technology is/was not satisfying. The workers were not satisfied with how it was before. There was an expressed need of new tools, functions or ways to work that could be met or simplified with the technology. Perceived ability (Self-efficacy) The users feel confident in how to use the technology. The users feel confident that they will know how to use the technology.

["adapting-the-technology-to-the-miners-human-factors.html", "18 Adapting the technology to the miners (Human factors)", " 18 Adapting the technology to the miners (Human factors) Erik Human-centred design, commonly interchanged with the term human factors design, is defined by Horberry, Burgess-Limerick, &amp; Steiner [1] as the science of designing equipment, workplaces, tasks and organisations to account for the users’ needs and wants. This means that designers need to ensure that they accommodate a wide range of users of different shapes, sizes, gender, age and more. It also entails considering the effect that the design has on other stakeholders, such as the maintenance workers who repair the equipment. The goal of human-centred design, or HCD, is to improve work performance and the safety, health and well-being of the workforce (and, if possible, society in large). The key principles for HCD can according to Horberry m.fl. (2018) be summarized as: Adapt the equipment, system or product to the needs and wants of the people who interact with it instead of having them accommodate the system or object. For example, controls and equipment should be designed to be easy to use and perform maintenance on. People shouldn’t have to work with the equipment or system in unhealthy or dangerous ways to make it function properly. Designing systems or equipment requires an understanding of the people who will interact with or be affected by it. Questions like what’s the context for their interaction, what tasks do they need to perform, in what environment and so forth need to be investigated. The continuous involvement of the users and other stakeholders in the design and development process is important to ensure that the previous principles can be upheld. The design process is iterative to ensure ideas and concepts are reworked until they fulfil established requirements. Amongst these requirements are needs to account for human-centred subjects such as usability, safety and ergonomics. Each stage of the design process of the equipment or system must accommodate the needs and wants of the people who will be interacting with it. There are several potential benefits with designing in accordance with human factors: May allow for solutions or performance improvements not otherwise possible. Improves operator performance, efficiency and lowers costs of training. Can help avoid additional costs and problems stemming from equipment, workplaces or tasks being badly adapted to the users. Demonstrates that the company accommodates their employees’ needs and wants. This can improve the attractiveness of the workplace and the products for potential employees and customers. Can improve employee acceptance of workplace aspects, changes and tasks. Can increase the trust from the people involved with the human factors-designed system. Human factors are rarely considered when designing mining equipment according to Horberry, Burgess-Limerick, &amp; Steiner [1]. Instead, focus often lies on what the technical aspects of the equipment can achieve. The people are often left to perform the tasks that the machines cannot. This doesn’t mean that there aren’t parts of the mining workplace where human-centred design has already been taken into account. Below are examples of areas of mining workplaces where human-centred design is designed for or should be designed for. The vehicles and machines used in mining have according to Simpson, Horberry, &amp; Joy [1] had problems with the visibility from the cabin for a long time. Due to the size and equipment of the vehicles, the drivers’ line of sight is often very limited. The risks and potential consequences of this have inspired the implementation or design of several preventative measures. These include added cameras to show the “blind spots” of the driver’s line of sight, proximity sensors to notify the driver on how close they are to things in their environment and more. The interfaces of mining equipment and machines often contain many buttons, levers and other interacthe tableelements. A human-centred design ensures, amongst other things, that no parts of the interface are difficult or unergonomic to reach. The most commonly used levers and buttons are the easiest to access. Furthermore, interacthe tableelements need to be grouped up on the interface according to function, for example by putting buttons next to the dials and screens that they interact with. Relating to unergonomic interfaces; foot rests, seats, handles and other physical elements of the machines can easily become uncomforthe tableor even perilous to use if they aren’t designed to accommodate people of different sizes and statures. Tools and equipment can have the same problem, where their weight and size doesn’t consider the physical capabilities of different users. To design with a human-centred focus is to ensure that equipment, tools and other elements in the workplace are comforthe tableand safe to use for more than just the average person. Making the equipment modifiable and adaptable, such as chairs that can be adjusted and helmets that can fit more people, helps ensure that all employees can safely and effectively use it. It isn’t enough, however, to ensure that the equipment is comforthe tableand safe for the users to work with. The equipment also needs to be designed with maintenance in mind. Maintenance hatches, engine housing and electronics need to be reasonably easy to access to not complicate maintenance work more than necessary. As for future technologies in mining, the batteries of the electrical vehicles that are to be implemented in the mines need to be easily charged and replaced. Designing and creating these future technologies provides an excellent opportunity to create machines, systems and equipment that accommodates the users and the people affected by them. There are aspects of the future vision for mining workplaces that likens a human-centred design thinking. Mining industries are moving towards utilizing more remote-controlled machines and control room work in mines. The mining operators can thus be removed from potentially dangerous or ergonomically unhealthy work tasks and environments. This reduces their exposure to vibrations, dust, blasting gases and the risks of cave-ins, improving the safety and health conditions of the workplace. With future mining workplaces consisting of more remote-controlled work, however, operators will spend more time doing static work in control rooms. The Swedish administrative authority Arbetsmiljöverket [1] warns of the potential health risks such as circulatory problems caused by too much static work. A workplace with a human-centred design should thus provide their employees with work tasks balanced between physical and static work. References "],
["iterative-design-of-mining-workplaces.html", "19 Iterative design of mining workplaces", " 19 Iterative design of mining workplaces Erik When making and implementing changes to mining industries, it’s rare to see large extensive changes take place, which is likely due to the complexities of the systems involved in a mine. Instead, changes are often implemented incrementally, with individual implementations coming together as a larger change effort over a longer period of time. The development and implementation of changes and solutions can sometimes take between 7 and 10 years to complete, after which they remain in use for at least just as long. The problem is that the changes may have already become obsolete at the point of their implementation due to this long implementation process. The designers and planners must thus ensure that they don’t introduce long-lasting changes that negatively affect the working environment. This can, however, become difficult due to how mining change projects are structured. According to Lööw, Johansson, Andersson, and Johansson [1], design processes in mining industries are rarely iterative and human-centred processes, instead following more linear processes with a technology-centred perspective. While these processes have been successful at times in the mining industry, there are cases where it’s only revealed which issues that are relevant late into the project. A linear process doesn’t allow for earlier parts of the process to be easily revisited, which could make necessary adjustments difficult or expensive. With how long the development times can be for mining implementations, this can risk invalidating several years’ worth of work. An iterative design process is more suited for adapting to changing goals and requirements, in addition to placing a greater focus on user feedback. This, in turn, provides better opportunities to create results that addresses relevant issues and user needs. The iterative design process has been described by several different authors as consisting of a varying number of steps. The process can be generalized, however, into four steps: planning, diagnosis of the present status, formulating demands, and creation and evaluation of proposals. When working with an iterative process, these four steps are followed in order, with more focus being put on the first steps early in the project. Once all steps have been completed, the process cycles back to the planning phase and work begins again, only this time more emphasis and detail is put on the following steps. Osvalder, Rose, Karlsson, Eklund, &amp; Odenrick [1] describes this design process using project circle similar to figure X. During the cycles, several different solutions should be created in order to compare and judge between different alternatives. The solutions that satisfy the demands of the project can then be assessed and combined with other solutions, while the solutions that don’t can be removed. This design process continues, with each cycle shifting the work focus more towards the final steps, until a final proposal has been gradually developed and chosen. Figur 1: An illustration of the project circle describing an iterative design process TEMP To more specifically describe the work that goes into the steps of an iterative work process, Ranhagen [1] starts with describing how the planning phase can be separated into three parts; formulating the goals in general terms, creating a project organisation, and separating the work into stages. A project organisation can consist of a decision-making body, a health and safety reference group and a project group. The important thing here is to include both people with experience in design work and people from the areas of the workplace that will be affected by the changes, like maintenance workers or miners. The second step of the iterative process, the diagnosis step, consists of documenting and investigating the current state of the workplace; what problems exist, how the work is done today, what will be done in the future, and so on. During the third step, functional demands are to be established and developed. These demands help guide the creation of concepts and solutions by serving as objectives that needs to be fulfilled. At the same time, they need to promote creativity by not specifying a certain solution, for example by having a demand for good air quality instead of a demand for extensive ventilation systems. If one demand is more important than another, a weight point can be applied to each demand that signifies its importance. The final fourth step entails using different creative methods to create solutions that can then be evaluated after how well they fulfil the established demands. Here, the weight of the demands can be combined with how well the solution fulfils it in order to create a score system, allowing the designers to see which solution that generally fulfils the demands best. It is important to note, however, that having the highest score doesn’t guarantee that the solution is the best choice. Before making a decision, the results should be assessed to see if the solution is sensible, or if another solution is a viable alternative despite not scoring as high. As mentioned before, the benefits of using iterative design processes in mining industries comes from the flexibility in creating solutions. This flexibility helps make projects less vulnerable to changes in focus, or if a new problem arises midway through. Furthermore, an iterative process offers more opportunities to create attractive workplaces for both new and existing employees by involving them more in the design process. This makes it easier to discover and adapt the solutions to their needs and wants, which helps create workplaces where they want to work. References "],
["more-research-is-needed.html", "20 More research is needed", " 20 More research is needed Jan Johansson, Lena Abrahamsson Future efficient mining operations will be dependent upon a highly competent and well motivated work force, on all levels. The mining companies will have to recruit their personnel from a limited group of talented individuals with high demands and expectations on future work. To cope with the future labour supply, the mining industry must change the image of mining work and increase the attractiveness of working in the sector, especially for young women and men. We know a lot about what creates an attractive job, but we don't know everything. It is important that the mining industry keeps up with this quest for knowledge, the world is changing and new knowledge is required. The winners are the ones who apply the knowledge quickly and translate it into practice. Below we describe a number of activities required in order to attract and keep skilled personnel in the future mining industry. To achieve this, we have identified six areas that need further clarification through research: Digitalization opens up for new opportunities to create attractive workplaces in a safe environment, and jobs that provide space for the employee's full expertise and creativity. But there are also risks that need to be addressed, such as privacy issues, increased stress and work-life boundaries. With the increased digitization, new qualifications are needed. These must be identified and programmes for reskilling and lifelong learning must be formed. Research on health and safety has been successful, but the industry still needs innovative methods to control health and safety-related issues. To be perceived as a safe industry, a zero vision is required based on better proactive safety work. Health and safety conditions for contractors must be explored and more inclusive safety cultures must be developed. Companies must be proactive and try to avoid creating problems in the first place. This is especially important in mining where initial mistakes can have consequences for a very long time. Finally, to develop a holistic concept for the attractive mine that can attract young people. Research must work with these issues from different time perspectives. The long-term vision is the zero-entry mine where all machines are self-regulated or remote-controlled from operations centres above ground. These centres are designed to promote co-operation and creative problem solving in multi-skilled teams of men and women. Basic safety level is not an issue anymore: dangerous work tasks are performed by robots. In a shorter perspective, many workers remain underground. Here, there are new methods for iterative mine planning that take work environment and safety into account and reduce common initial design errors when mines are planned; production is organised through a holistic approach based on production teams and broad professional skills among management and miners; mining work has been transformed into being attractive to both women and men, not only because of the wages, but also because it is an interesting occupation with good potential for personal and professional development and lifelong learning in a safe and sound working environment. Still, a number of issues of attractive workplaces should be considered in future research and innovation as well; the most important are addressed below. First, digitisation and its effects have an obvious place in a future research agenda. Used correctly, digitalisation can create attractive jobs that provide space for the employee's full expertise and creativity. But there are also risks which need to be analysed and considered. Furthermore, competence development, learning at work etc. should be prioritized. These topics are vital in order to meet the demands of new technology and can guarantee flexibility for the company and development in one’s professional role. Important focus areas for research are: How can the new roles of the operators (i.e. “Operator 4.0”) meet the values and expectations that young women and men have when they enter work life? How should digitised production systems address privacy issues? How to gain acceptance and avoid resistance for new technology? There is a need for new methods for learning at work, something both employers and employees want. To guarantee development in one’s professional role and inhibit becoming stuck in the demands of a special task requires a certain degree of generalness in competence development. Broad work roles are a classic demand that can also be combined with the ideas behind Lean mining. The industry has a general need to recruit more women. Important focus areas for research are: Identification of future skills requirements. Development of new education programmes for reskilling and competence development of management and workers as part of a lifelong learning. Develop a strategy for recruiting more women. Develop a mentor system for miners so that professional knowledge is transferred between generations. Develop VR and AR for training and simulation, particularly the operations in hazardous environments. Health and safety at work must have top priority. Mechanisation, remote control and automation are efficient preventive safety measures. They are also appropriate for reducing workload to avoid musculoskeletal injuries and allow for recovery periods. New technology makes it possible to both warn of dangerous working conditions and monitor employees' health conditions in real time. Improved safety is also a matter of a developed safety climate in the form of relevant education, rules and effective leadership, with safety prioritised in the day-to-day-work. In short, there is a need for further development of: How we can increase safety by monitoring the operators in real time? New methods for monitoring and controlling the work environment. Efficient tools for proactive safety control, as well as broader analyses of the impact of digitalization on health and safety in general. Upgraded safety climate. Moreover, the increased number of contractors must be addressed. Focus should be on the benefits and potential problems that come from a workforce of in-house personnel and contractors. This includes strengthening both formal (e.g. implementing joint safety management practices) and informal (e.g. communication and interaction in the workplace) relations in multi-employer worksites. Important issues in this area include: Reviews of the health and safety conditions for contractors in mining The development a safety culture that includes contractor. Many problems in the work environment in present mines (and in other industry as well) can be traced back to insufficient initial physical planning and design. Since mining is characterized by huge investments and long term operations it is very important with a well designed physical production system. The physical layout also influences and limits the organizational aspects. If initial mistakes are made the personnel will have to stand the negative consequences for many years to come. The initial design phases of every major development project are therefore critical for establishing a safe and attractive physical and psycho-social work environment in a mine. The main idea and research task in this challenge is to combine and further develop a general iterative industrial planning and design method Ranhagen [1] with available and relevant work environment tools and combine them with the demands of the new technology. The final product, that is planning guidelines with focus on work environment design in underground mines, shall be adapted to the users (pre-study engineers, feasibility engineers, project planners, automation engineers, layout planners, ventilation planners etc.) needs and professional situation. Such guidelines, preferably integrated with CAD-planning and design tools, would help these professional to create more safe and attractive future workplaces in the mines. Designers of mine productions systems also have quite a lot of legislation and compulsory provisions to regard as well as company specific rules and standards for the work environment and the management of health and safety Johansson and Johansson [1]. These aspects must also be integrated in the guidelines for work environment planning and design. The major research task can be described as: Development of alternative guidelines for early and critical stages of future mine design. Finally, although the traditional image of mining is not particularly attractive and the industry still has health and safety issues that need to be considered, we think that it is possible to create a new vision of future mining - a vision of a high technology industry that speaks to today's young people. Mining companies must more actively demonstrate their social responsibility. Employees want to feel proud to work in the company, which means that issues such as vision, mission and core values are important. If we manage these problems well, they can be turned into advantages that create new, attractive job roles. All these factors affect the company's image, and thus the possibility of recruiting young talented people to the industry. Overall, broader strategic research areas should include matters related to the development of a holistic concept for the zero entry mine; the development of efficient programmes for development of attractive societies; the development of a model for an ethical, ecological and diverse workplace and recognised as a green branch; and give the industry a new image that can attract young people. The mining industry must be prepared to meet the technological development on human terms. In a longer perspective, this can lead to the recognition of the mining industry as an ethical, ecological and diverse industry that can offer challenging jobs and attractive workplaces.

There are many aspects, issues and questions that must be considered and addressed in order to achieve that goal, enough that it would be very difficult to try and address them all at once. Making wider, simpler analyses on the current state of a mining workplace, however, can still be useful. Identifying what areas of a mining workplace that can be changed to improve safety and attractiveness should be done to allow for early analysis and planning of actions. It’s possible, however, that people become blind to the faults and needs for improvement in their working environment. This checklist aims to help highlight potential areas of improvement in a mining workplace that could make it a safer and more attractive workplace, without presenting in-depth solutions that may limit the decision-making process.
