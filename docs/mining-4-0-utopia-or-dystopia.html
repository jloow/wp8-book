<h1><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Mining 4.0 - Utopia or Dystopia</h1>
<p>In previous chapters, we have described various development
opportunities for future mining work. Here we will try to summarize our
experiences in two extremes, a negative dystopian development and a
positive utopian. The two visions are read and illustrated on
<a href="http://www.xxxvv"><span class="underline">www.xxxvv</span></a>. The chapter concludes with
six recommendations on how to start shaping the future of Mining 4.0 on
human terms</p>
<p>How will Mining 4.0 affect tomorrow's mining work? There is no clear
answer to that question. There is no inherent technological determinism
in the development; it will depend on the choices that we make. It's up
to us. The dystopian scenario gives this miserable picture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You have to be grateful that you even have a job. Most of the jobs
have disappeared, and the entire municipality is depopulated. There
are some qualified jobs located in the control center above ground,
but most of these jobs have moved to town and are carried out remotely
via the net. Some work is even done from India. It's not just an A
and B team anymore; we now also have a C team. What remains is mostly
maintenance work. We are wearing augmented-reality glasses and
carrying out tasks according to the instructions that we get from
central maintenance or a machine supplier. Sometimes we have to put on
an exo-skeleton</em> <em>if there is heavy lifting.</em></p>
<p><em>But everything is not bad. The work is not as dangerous as before,
because we do not work at the front nowadays, and there are no diesel
vehicles anymore. Underground everything is automated, but of course
we must install the electricity and access points, and then you notice
that the company has reduced the ventilation. The blasting gases still
remain far into the shift and you can feel your heading getting
heavier as the day drags on. What I miss most is my workmates; we have
our mobile phones and tablets so that we can keep in touch with each
other, but it is not the same as when working with the boys.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The utopian vision becomes much more pleasant to accept:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Most of the underground work is automated and no one works near the
front anymore. The production control takes place from a bright and
pleasant control room above ground. The routine monitoring work has
been automated; with AI you get a better stability in production. Our
professional role has been extended to include the entire value flow,
from mountain to customer. If we see an opportunity for improvement,
we can switch over to our digital twin to experiment and test the
outcome.It is always fun if you can trim the production; and then not
only financial measures apply, but also so-called green measures, such
as saving water or reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We are quite
proud that our company takes a great social responsibility, not only
for the environment but for a prosperous society that can offer a rich
social and cultural environment.</em></p>
<p><em>When something goes wrong in the production, it is indicated in our
mobile phones and usually we can solve it with a few keystrokes. But
sometimes we have to go into a VR model and maybe direct a robot to a
crusher to break apart a boulder. If the error has not occurred
before, we sometimes have to go down into the mine to understand what
has happened. When we are forced to go down into the mine, we always
wear a safety vest with sensors so that one can follow where we are
and warn if any dangerous environmental factors appears, or if
something seems strange to our health.</em></p>
<p><em>Last month my daughter even started working for the company. She is a
computer science major but works as much with my colleagues as she
does with a computer. For a long time, I thought I would be the last
miner in the family. It feels good to know that there will be a new
generation, and that young people have stopped moving away. It seems
the company’s investments in the community, and insistence on training
and using locals, really payed off.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scenarios are exaggerated but probable. Mining 4.0 can definitely
represent a positive development, but there are many questions that must
be cleared. Based on our experiences and and previous research, we want
to bring forward six recommendations that can be considered as a
beginning of a road map for developing Mining 4.0 on human terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We need more ways of measuring success, ways that capture social
factors.</p></li>
<li><p>Any reduction in the workforce must be managed with great
transparency and in close cooperation with the trade unions.</p></li>
<li><p>All employees must be included in competence development; leave
nobody behind.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a flat organization that empowers employees and encourages
their creativity.</p></li>
<li><p>Handle privacy and integrity issues in close cooperation with the
trade unions and workers.</p></li>
<li><p>Embed all changes in a context of great social responsibility</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important that the mining industry is active in creating Mining
4.0, but we also know that it will take time and there will be many
obstacles along the way. To succeed we must be vigilant and attentive to
all aspect of modern mining – future as well as past.</p>
