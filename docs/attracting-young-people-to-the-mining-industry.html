<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Attracting young people to the mining industry</h1>
<p>In most mines the present workforce is ageing and mining companies have
difficulties recruiting young talented people. A precondition for being
able to recruit the right workforce is that the mining industry can
offer workplaces that attract the youths of tomorrow. In order to
succeed, the mining companies need to know what in fact constitute
attractive jobs and workplaces in mining as well as how they can change
their own present operations to align with these requirements. These
changes need to be based on current and relevant research on work
attractiveness. However, labour supply is determined not only by the
work itself and the working environment but just as much of the society
and what it can offer its residents. There are a number of factors that
have an impact on the attractiveness of society, such as social
relations to family, friends and relatives, opportunities regarding work
and education, housing and leisure activities. These factors must also
be considered when creating the mines of the future.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no single accepted definition of what
constitutes an attractive job and current explanations and models
differ. While pay and the possibilities of advancement are two general
factors, answers have varied in, for example, different time periods and
fields of research. It follows that what is attractive also differs
between countries, since the general contexts differ, as well as
individuals.</p>
<p>A general model for attractive work is presented by <span class="citation">Åteg, Hedlund, and Pontén (<a href="#ref-Ateg2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>. In this model, three factors, covering 22 dimensions (see
table <a href="attracting-young-people-to-the-mining-industry.html#tab:work-attr">2.1</a>), interact and contribute to the
attractiveness of work. In comparison with previous, similar models
<span class="citation">Åteg, Hedlund, and Pontén (<a href="#ref-Ateg2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> have added work satisfaction as a factor. This factor is
especially important for keeping people at work, <span class="citation">Åteg, Hedlund, and Pontén (<a href="#ref-Ateg2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> argue.</p>

<p>In another model, <span class="citation">Hedlund (<a href="#ref-Hedlund2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> states that a job is attractive for a
person if he/she wants the job and wants to keep it. Thus, an individual
can judge the attractiveness both as an applicant (external view) and as
an employee (internal view). This means that a job can be described in
four different ways: attractive, hidden, idealized and unattractive (see
figure <a href="attracting-young-people-to-the-mining-industry.html#fig:fig1">2.1</a>). Accordingly, a job is attractive if it has a
high attractiveness from both an internal and an external point of view.
A job with high internal attractiveness but low external attractiveness
is classified as hidden, while a job with low internal attractiveness
but high external attractiveness is regarded as idealized. Finally, a
job that has a low attractiveness from both an internal and external
view is classified as unattractive.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Thus an individual’s relation to work, experience of work and wishes and
expectations are important components that form the perception of work
attractiveness, i.e. different people have varying opinions of the same
job depending on their personal situation and preferences. In essence,
it can be said that the relative importance of each dimension in the
model by <span class="citation">Åteg, Hedlund, and Pontén (<a href="#ref-Ateg2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> depend on the individual. Additionally, we
argue that the weight of a dimension may even be negative. This has the
effect that an “objectively” attractive job may be perceived as
unattractive.</p>

<p>In figure <a href="attracting-young-people-to-the-mining-industry.html#fig:fig1">2.1</a> we have used <span class="citation">Hedlund (<a href="#ref-Hedlund2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>’s model to
illustrate a plausible present situation for the mining sector. The
attractive section is quite small and the view from an internal position
is more positive than one from an external position. Thus we argue that
the mining industry needs to expand job attractiveness, both for
external and internal viewers. As was shown in the above models, this
expansion can be achieved in a large number of ways. Essentially,
present attractive qualities must be presented and not hidden away from
applicants and potential staff. Unattractive or repelling job features
must be eliminated or decreased, resulting in a situation close to that
in figure <a href="attracting-young-people-to-the-mining-industry.html#fig:fig2">2.2</a>.</p>

<!--![](../media/media/image2.png){width="3.625in"

<p>The question is how to achieve this expansion of attractiveness. Based
on our experiences from the SIMS project and other similar projects, we
have summarized our findings in six recommendations for creating
attractive workplaces and increasing the visibility of the good parts of
mining work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Health and safety at work must have top priority. Mechanization,
remote control, and automation are efficient preventive safety
measures, but are also appropriate for reducing workload to avoid
musculoskeletal injuries and allow for recovery periods. Improved
safety is also a matter of a developed safety climate in the form of
relevant education, rules and effective leadership where safety
clearly is prioritized in the day-to-day-work.</p></li>
<li><p>A work organization based on groups as an operative unit where all
employees have control over their own work cycle. This very concrete
demand guarantees a variety at work while also providing meaningful
autonomy. The demand can also be combined with a Lean approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Competence development, and learning at work are important to
guarantee flexibility for the company and development in one’s
professional role. It is also a question about changing into a
workplace culture that follows the developments in the industry,
such as new production techniques, new products, and new quality
demands.</p></li>
<li><p>Gender equality is essential for the mining industry to being viewed
as a modern employer. The industry must break away from its
macho-masculine image.</p></li>
<li><p>The mining companies must more actively demonstrate their social
responsibility. Employees want to feel proud to work in the company,
so issues such as vision, mission and core values are important.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus should be placed on the benefits as well as the potential
problems that may come with having a workforce consisting of both
in-house personnel and contractors. This includes an emphasis on
strengthening both the formal (e.g. implementing joint safety
management practices) and informal (e.g. communication and
interaction on a workplace level) relations on the emerging
multi-employer worksites.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if the mining industry wants to improve its image and recruit
young people in the future, they have to broaden their perspective. New
technology is important and can solve many problems, but not all of
them. Technology must be complemented with a social perspective that
includes attractive and safe workplaces in a social functioning society,
sought-after workplaces in a company that people are proud to work for.</p>
