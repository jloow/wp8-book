So far it is a work in progress.1 It is a book that intends to give the reader some tools to help them in the social management of new technology. It is aimed chiefly at the mining industry; due to its unique characteristics, much traditional knowledge – or rather, knowledge regarding these issues from other industries – are not readily applicable. Therefore, this book seeks to adapt much of “uncontextualised” knowledge to the mining industry. To do so, we use the technologies of SIMS. About the project The vision of SIMS is to create a long lasting impact on the way we test and demonstrate new technology and solutions for the mining industry. With a selected consortium ranging from mining companies, equipment and system suppliers to top-class universities, the SIMS project will boost development and innovation through joint activities aiming at creating Sustainable Intelligent Mining Systems.

["attracting-young-people-to-the-mining-industry.html", "2 Attracting young people to the mining industry See also", " 2 Attracting young people to the mining industry In most mines the present workforce is ageing and mining companies have difficulties recruiting young talented people. A precondition for being able to recruit the right workforce is that the mining industry can offer workplaces that attract the youths of tomorrow. In order to succeed, the mining companies need to know what in fact constitute attractive jobs and workplaces in mining as well as how they can change their own present operations to align with these requirements. These changes need to be based on current and relevant research on work attractiveness. However, labour supply is determined not only by the work itself and the working environment but just as much of the society and what it can offer its residents. There are a number of factors that have an impact on the attractiveness of society, such as social relations to family, friends and relatives, opportunities regarding work and education, housing and leisure activities. These factors must also be considered when creating the mines of the future. Unfortunately, there is no single accepted definition of what constitutes an attractive job and current explanations and models differ. While pay and the possibilities of advancement are two general factors, answers have varied in, for example, different time periods and fields of research. It follows that what is attractive also differs between countries, since the general contexts differ, as well as individuals. A general model for attractive work is presented by Åteg, Hedlund, and Pontén (2004). In this model, three factors, covering 22 dimensions (see table 2.1), interact and contribute to the attractiveness of work. In comparison with previous, similar models Åteg, Hedlund, and Pontén (2004) have added work satisfaction as a factor. This factor is especially important for keeping people at work, Åteg, Hedlund, and Pontén (2004) argue. Table 2.1: Work attractiveness. Attractive working conditions Attractive work content Work satisfaction Adequate equipment and tools Working hours Physical work environment Leadership Loyalty Location Wage Organization Relations Social contact Work pace Familiarity Physical activity Freedom to act Practical work Theoretical work Variation Demand, need Recognition Status Stimulation Results In another model, Hedlund (2007) states that a job is attractive for a person if he/she wants the job and wants to keep it. Thus, an individual can judge the attractiveness both as an applicant (external view) and as an employee (internal view). This means that a job can be described in four different ways: attractive, hidden, idealized and unattractive (see figure 2.1). Accordingly, a job is attractive if it has a high attractiveness from both an internal and an external point of view. A job with high internal attractiveness but low external attractiveness is classified as hidden, while a job with low internal attractiveness but high external attractiveness is regarded as idealized. Finally, a job that has a low attractiveness from both an internal and external view is classified as unattractive. Figure 2.1: The attractiveness of the mining industry illustrated. Thus an individual’s relation to work, experience of work and wishes and expectations are important components that form the perception of work attractiveness, i.e. different people have varying opinions of the same job depending on their personal situation and preferences. In essence, it can be said that the relative importance of each dimension in the model by Åteg, Hedlund, and Pontén (2004) depend on the individual. Additionally, we argue that the weight of a dimension may even be negative. This has the effect that an “objectively” attractive job may be perceived as unattractive. In figure 2.1 we have used Hedlund (2007)’s model to illustrate a plausible present situation for the mining sector. The attractive section is quite small and the view from an internal position is more positive than one from an external position. Thus we argue that the mining industry needs to expand job attractiveness, both for external and internal viewers. As was shown in the above models, this expansion can be achieved in a large number of ways. Essentially, present attractive qualities must be presented and not hidden away from applicants and potential staff. Unattractive or repelling job features must be eliminated or decreased, resulting in a situation close to that in figure 2.2. Figure 2.2: How the attractiveness of the mining industry must develop. The question is how to achieve this expansion of attractiveness. Based on our experiences from the SIMS project and other similar projects, we have summarized our findings in six recommendations for creating attractive workplaces and increasing the visibility of the good parts of mining work: Health and safety at work must have top priority. Mechanization, remote control, and automation are efficient preventive safety measures, but are also appropriate for reducing workload to avoid musculoskeletal injuries and allow for recovery periods. Improved safety is also a matter of a developed safety climate in the form of relevant education, rules and effective leadership where safety clearly is prioritized in the day-to-day-work. A work organization based on groups as an operative unit where all employees have control over their own work cycle. This very concrete demand guarantees a variety at work while also providing meaningful autonomy. The demand can also be combined with a Lean approach. Competence development, and learning at work are important to guarantee flexibility for the company and development in one’s professional role. It is also a question about changing into a workplace culture that follows the developments in the industry, such as new production techniques, new products, and new quality demands. Gender equality is essential for the mining industry to being viewed as a modern employer. The industry must break away from its macho-masculine image. The mining companies must more actively demonstrate their social responsibility. Employees want to feel proud to work in the company, so issues such as vision, mission and core values are important. Focus should be placed on the benefits as well as the potential problems that may come with having a workforce consisting of both in-house personnel and contractors. This includes an emphasis on strengthening both the formal (e.g. implementing joint safety management practices) and informal (e.g. communication and interaction on a workplace level) relations on the emerging multi-employer worksites. Finally, if the mining industry wants to improve its image and recruit young people in the future, they have to broaden their perspective. New technology is important and can solve many problems, but not all of them. Technology must be complemented with a social perspective that includes attractive and safe workplaces in a social functioning society, sought-after workplaces in a company that people are proud to work for.

["fix-the-problems-before-they-occur.html", "3 Fix the problems before they occur", " 3 Fix the problems before they occur A heavy responsibility for safe mines lays on the mine planners shoulders. They must find solutions that promote high productivity and good economy as well as safety and a healthy work environment. The mine planners will initially shape the general and specific work environment for miners for many years to come. If the planners design a poor solution and it is necessary to redesign it, it will also probably be very expensive to correct after it has been implemented. Work environment and safety issues are unfortunately often left quite unattended in the early stages of mine planning and design when they instead should be systematically highlighted and developed from the very first planning steps. The best and most efficient way to gain a good safety is through proactive planning instead of reactive corrective actions. It is also the best way to reduce the associated costs for risk elimination and reduction. The mine planner is however not alone, he or she works in a company context where safety climate and culture, safety policy and safety management have a strong influence on how well the planner can succeed in his work. The slogan “Safety first” has been heard in the mining business for many decades but is still in many cases not more than a slogan since safety first is not fully practiced, especially if the business has financial problems. It seems however that the times are changing and many mining companies are now making great efforts to improve their safety climate and safety culture. Research on safety has shown that at positive safety climate and well developed safety culture is an important requisite for a healthy and safe work environment, especially in heavy industries. In order to manage the risks in the business every mining company is also in need of a strategic long-term policy regarding how to deal with safety issues and strive for better work conditions. The safety policy shall direct and establish systematic ways to manage (plan, steer and control) the safety work, also including early planning and design activities. Because mining is a very risky business it has to follow and obey a lot of directives, laws and provisions. Most of these rules only stipulate minimum demands and the companies are free to exceed them. This is also what mine planners should aim at, exceeding minimum demands. A first step for a mine planner is therefore to get acquainted with the national and international (ie EU regulations) system of rules and basic demands. Many of these demands are provided by the national or EU authorities. This has to be done in a thorough way in each country there are quite a large number of directives, laws and provisions that regulate and give guidelines for health and safety issues in underground mining. The basis for all activities in systematic health and safety work shall always be an initial thorough risk assessment both of the present state and a future planned state. It is of course easier to assess present or historical risks than future risks, especially if the future holds large changes in technology and or work organization. Still a mine planner needs to assess the risks with different mining concepts that are developed and planned. Mining might develop in a revolutionary way, but will most probably develop in another way, in an evolutionary way. This means that much can be learned from history and from the present state. Thorough evaluations of present and historic designs have for example systematically been used by the Swedish mining company LKAB in the design of their newest main level at 1365 m below surface. This evaluation has been very important since the time span from the first conceptual designs to the final solutions has stretched over 12 years and a large number of planners. Risk assessments can be performed in number of ways depending on the situation and circumstances. All risk assessment shall however be based on probability and consequence for unwanted events. A practical tool for this purpose is a risk matrix that eases a systematic and consequent risk assessment (see figure 3.1). Figure 3.1: Risk matrix based on probability and consequence. As can be seen in figure 3.1 probability is expressed as a frequency for a specific event or deviation. The assessed risk level during planning can also be coupled to a specified need for action, (see 3.2). Figure 3.2: Risk level and need for action during planning The risk matrix for risk assessments during planning can also with some modification be used for risk assessments in the operative production stages (see 3.3). The risk matrix has therefore become a quite well known and used tool in the mining companies. Figure 3.3: Risk matrix based on probability and consequence. The classical tools for the identification of occupational risks in the existing production environments are Safety rounds, Incident and Accident reporting. These tools are however less suitable to identify and assess risks in future work environments. There you need other types of more proactive methods such as: Preventive deviation analysis Preventive energy analysis A deviation is according to Harms-Ringdahl (2013) defined as an event or condition that deviates from the intended or normal. The purpose of a deviation analysis is to prevent, to predict abnormalities that can cause damage and to develop proposals to improve safety measures. Deviation Analysis is a very useful method since it takes into account the entire system, Human-Technology-Organization. Energy analysis focuses more on technology and might be useful when developing new productions systems. Three main components considered in an energy analysis are: Energy that can damage Targets that may be harmed Barriers to Energy The energies usually considered are: Gravity, height (including static load); Linear motion; Rotary motion; Stored pressure; Electrical energy; Heating and cooling; Fire and explosion; Chemical effects; Radiation; Miscellaneous (human movement, sharp edges, and points). There are also many other different risk analysis methods that can be used during the development of new production systems. Besides the methods mentioned above methods like Preventive Work Safety Analysis (PWSA), Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Event Tree Analysis (ETA), Work Environment Screening Tool (WEST) etc. are possible to use. The most appropriate tools have to be chosen for every specific analysis task and the users of the tools must also have the necessary competence in order to attain reliable and relevant results. Here the mining business probably can learn much from other industry that has a strong safety culture and long experience of systematic risk management. Especially important will be to learn how to proactively manage risks for fatalities and other severe risks. Here so called leading indicators are preferred instead of lagging indicators Even if there are many risk evaluation tools available mining industry seem to need new and efficient tools for description, evaluation and design of work environment during early phases of strategic decision making and production system design. The most important decisions regarding work environment and safety are made by top management when mining methods, technology, work organization etc. is decided. Therefore risk analyses regarding these matters should be made as early as possible in the mine design process. Once a risk analysis is completed it often requires measures which in most situations should be implemented in the following well known order: Prevent already in the planning stage, replace the hazards entirely. For example, through automation to eliminate manual or mechanized underground work. Isolate the individual hazard, risk process. For example, by designing ventilation and layout so that the blasting fumes can’t be spread outside the risk zone. Change process technology and behavior. For example, DTH-drilling with water hydraulics rather than pneumatics to reduce dust emissions. Limit the hazard through enclosures, physical protection. For example, build concrete borders and railings at the shaft openings. Isolate personnel from the hazard risk area. For example, by supplying the mining vehicles with safety cabs with good climate control. Risk is reduced by instructions, procedures, training, etc. For example, procedures for safe handling of explosives. Risk is reduced through personal protective equipment. For example, functional working clothes. Depending on the complexity and severity of problems one may require different combinations of measures as described above. One recommendation is to always try to attack the root causes of the problem first. It tends to result in the most cost efficient and result efficient solutions. This is an important task for mine planners. They have the best opportunity to eliminate a lot of potential health and safety problems when they develop the first conceptual solutions. Planners that don’t realize this and neglect these matters can cause great harm for many years to the mining personnel and their company. References "],
["future-of-metal-mining.html", "4 Future of metal mining See also", " 4 Future of metal mining The world’s metal mining industry is rapidly changing and faces a number of challenges which must be addressed with a socio-technical approach that covers the whole mining and minerals value adding chain including environmental issues. We have tried to capture this uncertain future in fourteen predictions presented below: Future mining will be shaped in a context where it is necessary to produce at costs that are determined in international competition. The prices of metals and minerals are set by the market but in the long term, there is little doubt that the demand is increasing. Large nations like China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and the whole of Africa will require a larger share of consumption which is leading to the opening of new mines. The difference between these countries' annual “per capita”-consumption and Western Europe can be more than 10 times. Production conditions will be characterized by the fact that the nearby and easily accessible ores will be mined first. New ores will also become more distant or found in the depths. Large ore reserves are located under the sea and there is hardly any doubt that the mining and off-shore companies will develop new technology to extract these. In both cases, production costs will increase. Mining depths increase, and it brings new stability problems. The role of rock mechanics in the design of layouts, cutting sequences, strata stabilization, roof bolting etc. must be a central issue for the future. Full face drilling and cutting should be interesting from a safety perspective, both directly in safer drifting operations and also in that it can create more stable galleries due to reduced or no blasting damages. Cutting should also be useful for selective mining of high quality ore in narrow ore bodies. Production drilling and blasting for controlled fragmentation are two very crucial operations in the ore mining cycle. Improvements in these operations opens up many possibilities for automation. The environmental requirements affect both energy consumption and management of ore tailings. The discussion of energy consumption is largely linked to global warming and carbon emissions. Today not all nations have joined the Paris Climate Agreement, but in the long term, some form of coordination surely will be established. The cost of emission allowances will be a significant factor to consider. The mining industry is an energy-intensive industry with high CO2 emission. Improvement of energy efficiency will increase the economic profitability as well as reducing environmental impact. There are many components that affect the total energy consumption; one often discussed is underground pre-concentration (in situ). It affects directly the energy consuming hoisting and milling. The use of fossil diesel fuel is extensive and causes environmental burdens. A transition to electric power and battery operation is in progress. The discussion of waste management is about to leave as few footprints in nature as possible. We must not leave toxic substances which leak out into nature and the landscape should be restored as far as possible. One solution discussed is in situ mining where as much as possible of the production and processing will take place underground. Such technology is however not without environmental risks and risks for health and safety. Pollution of mine water is the single most important environmental issue for the mining sector and consequently also effective mine water treatment. With regard to water in general it is a question about closing the loops and re-using the process water as much as possible. The environmental debate also includes a discussion on the mining industry's social responsibility for the welfare of the local community. In addition to preserving the environment they are supposed to build a strong technical and social infrastructure that ensures survival of society after mining has ceased. Health and safety are very high on the agenda and are also strong driving forces behind the ideas of automation. In the future we will have a production with zero entry for employees underground based on automation and remote control A generally good and safe working environment is seen as a prerequisite for the recruitment of skilled workers. The typical underground work environment with noise, dust and toxic fumes and gasses will be monitored by using advanced sampling strategies with portable, more accurate and reliable measuring devices and more efficient counter measures can be taken. Industrie 4.0 is based on implementation of Internet of Things, 5G and Big data where the entire production process is included in internet-based networks that transform the mines to smart mines. We will soon see the outlines for Mining 4.0 where miners equipped with mini cameras can for everyday and emergency situations provide their colleagues and senior management with information that is difficult to convey verbally. The extended business and open collaboration are two concepts where VR technology can be used to link production functions such as planning, mining, maintenance, logistics, purchasing and for coordination of external contractors, suppliers, customers, etc. all connected to a production flow, a value adding chain, where all share the same goal and everyone sees the same whole. Common visualization of problems and opportunities in the system allows for all to optimize the whole chain rather than sub-optimizing parts. New professional roles with a higher proportion of remote control from production centers and collaborative visualization rooms, perhaps located in nearby communities, or further away (other continents), where the operators have monitoring and coordinating activities across the value chain. Their jobs will change character towards service work and the new tasks require different kinds of skills. In addition to deal with advanced information technology the miners have to interact with different specialist team located all over the world. New technology create a new type of work - new in terms of competencies and knowledge as well as workload. There is an emerging, and in many aspects already evident, knowledge transformation – from the old and obsolete physical and tacit knowledge and skills (for example the ability to ‘read the rock’) to something new which can be described as abstract knowledge. This can challenge the identity of the miners and create a resistance to change. The mines of the future will have a smaller staffing and it is also clear that they will meet a different kind of model for work organization than today. Mining companies will gradually turn to a flat and lean organization with multi-skilled workers who can operate in several areas and functions within the company. There is also a discussion about staffing system based on fly-in fly-out which is more independent of a local community. There are of course other important areas of development, but the above discussed are expressed as the most important from a long-term strategic and sustainable view. A major conclusion is that the challenges and the changes are so large and numerous that a comprehensive international cooperation is needed both within and outside the industry in order to succeed. Working separately would lead to a far to slow development, something that is undesirable for both the companies and the miners. Another conclusion is that a successful mining industry must work simultaneously with all the problems mentioned above. There is a need for a new and modern vision for the whole industry based on a socio-technical approach that covers the whole mining and minerals value adding chain including environmental issues.
