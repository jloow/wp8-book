So far it is a work in progress.1 It is a book that intends to give the reader some tools to help them in the social management of new technology. It is aimed chiefly at the mining industry; due to its unique characteristics, much traditional knowledge – or rather, knowledge regarding these issues from other industries – are not readily applicable. Therefore, this book seeks to adapt much of “uncontextualised” knowledge to the mining industry. To do so, we use the technologies of SIMS. About the project About the authors To a certain extent, it will always be a work in progress; see the later chapters.↩ "],
