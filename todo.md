What I gotta fix
================

- [x] 'About the authors' should not be numbered
- [ ] Fix references chapter
- [ ] Should chapter 3 have subheadings?
- [ ] Make author text look nicer

- [x] Fix the footnotes
- [ ] Footnote in chap 5
- [x] Fix table in chap 7
- [x] Picture in chap 12 does not show -- it is an emf file, change it

- [x] Have local copies of images in chap 16 or hide the reference link
- [ ] Fix chap 22

Not on my table
