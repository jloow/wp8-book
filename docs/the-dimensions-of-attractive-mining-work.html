<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> The Dimensions of Attractive Mining Work</h1>
<p>As mentioned in chapter 2, the mining industry has had difficulty with
hiring people from younger generations and should as such look for ways
to improve the attractiveness of mining workplaces. The 22 dimensions of
attractiveness described by <span class="citation">Åteg, Hedlund, and Pontén (<a href="#ref-Ateg2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> that were
discussed in chapter 2 are presented as more generally applicable
aspects of attractive workplaces. In an effort to investigate if and how
these aspects of attractive work could be applied to mining workplaces,
<span class="citation">Lööw et al. (<a href="#ref-Loow2018b" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> examined the 22
dimensions and their relation to the mining industry. Below is a list
describing each of the dimensions which includes descriptions of how
they are best fulfilled and how mining workplaces are affected by and
can affect the attractiveness of the workplace.</p>
<p><strong>Attractive working conditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Adequate equipment and tools:</em> Modern equipment capable of
providing good results efficiently and safely should be provided.
Equipment should be designed to accommodate people of different
sizes and with different needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The equipment in the mining industry has a history of having
trouble accommodating the people that use them. With new
technologies comes opportunities to design attractive equipment
that accommodate both new and existing employees’ needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Leadership:</em> There should exist proper trust, communication and
cooperation between employees and management. Management should feel
safe in letting the operators have more control over the planning
and execution of work tasks and with letting them partake in
decision-making. Employees should feel like they can safely give
suggestions and voice concerns, while also trusting that management
will take their needs into account when making changes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Location:</em> It’s important that the workplace is located close to
home, that there is proper transportation to work and that the
surrounding society is developed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mining companies cannot easily accommodate this aspect due to
being bound by mineral deposits’ locations. However, providing
adequate transportation and housing, and investing in local
societies, they can mitigate the negative effects on
attractiveness.</p></li>
<li><p>While bringing in personnel through Fly in/Fly out-methods is an
alternative, European mines generally try to avoid relying on
them.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Loyalty:</em> Employees should be loyal to and be treated with loyalty
from the company, their colleagues and across organisational
boundaries by cooperating and making sacrifices for each other.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establishing trust is an important factor for promoting loyalty.
Management must ensure that the employees can trust them to make
decisions and changes that are designed with their needs in
mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Another important factor is to provide transparency. Management
should detail and explain how and why certain decisions are
taken, which in turn helps build trust.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Organisation:</em> A successful company can be more attractive, in
addition to having low turnover, being in a good economic situation
and providing advancement possibilities and benefits. The size of
the organisation also affects the attractiveness, where smaller
companies tend to be more attractive.</p>
<ul>
<li>In modern mining companies, there is a trend amongst
organizations to adapt something called Lean mining. It is meant
to help rationalise and make their productions and organisations
more effective by implementing Lean philosophies. It entails a
focus on quality of infrastructure and safety, production
uptime, flexible and multi-skilled workers, and teamwork.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Physical work environment:</em> Attractive locales should have nice
appearances and furnishing, pollutant-free air, low sound levels and
they should be clean.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The move towards control room work helps mitigate negative
impacts by removing the operators from the potentially risky
mining workplaces for much of the work.</p></li>
<li><p>Proper ventilation, noise protection and tunnels clear from
debris is vital for a good work environment in a mine, even with
more remote-controlled work.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Relations:</em> The employees need relations at the workplace that
provide support and empathy, with good team spirit, camaraderie,
cooperation, honesty and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Future mining work provides good opportunities to develop good
work relationships with your colleagues if team members work in
the same control rooms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Social contact:</em> The workplace allows for social interactions with
other people, such as customers or colleagues.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With control room work, people can more easily speak with their
colleagues face-to-face.</p></li>
<li><p>As mining work may sometimes require working alone, proper
equipment for communication should be provided to avoid
isolating operators.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Wage:</em> It is important that the wage provided is of a sufficient
level, that it allows for people to support themselves and that it
gradually increases.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wages in mining workplaces are generally higher than average,
which could contribute to attractiveness should other factors be
addressed.</p></li>
<li><p>Wages shouldn’t be based on produced results, both to provide a
stable wage and to promote healthier ways of working. This is
due to piece rate wages having been shown to increase the risk
for workplace accidents to occur as it leads to safety
procedures being neglected to increase production rates.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Working hours:</em> Reasonable working hours that are predetermined and
configurable can make a workplace more attractive. The employees
should always know when they start and get off work while also being
able to influence the scope, distribution over the week and plan
vacations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mining usually relies on around-the-clock working hours. Setting
up offices in larger cities that remotely control machines in
the mines far away would access a larger employee base, making
it easier to find people willing to accommodate these working
hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Working in extended shifts of 10-12 hours is common in the
mining industry, but it increases the risk for accidents to
occur the longer the shift. As such, it should be avoided in
favour of more standard working hours at around 8 hours per
shift.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attractive work content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Familiarity:</em> The employee should know what to do and what to
expect in the workplace. This requires proper training, access to
work instructions and an incentive to utilize that information.</p>
<ul>
<li>With the implementation of 5G in mines and a digitalization of
work, it will become easier to communicate with others and
access work instructions whenever needed, even when below
ground.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p><em>Freedom of action:</em> The employees should be able to organize and
control their own and others’ work, for instance by influencing the
planning and execution of work tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Working from control rooms and with digitalized systems could
give more opportunities for controlling one’s work. For example,
operators could more easily swap between and choose which
machines in what parts of the mine to operate.</p></li>
<li><p>Freedom of action could also be provided by placing the smallest
planning level on the work group level. Management would no
longer need to create individual plans and schedules for each
employee. Instead, the work groups would be provided with goals
and missions after which they could plan their work accordingly,
thus giving the work groups more control over their work.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Physical activity:</em> The workplace should allow and include healthy
physical activity and movement to help prevent employees from
suffering static work-related injuries or health problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the automation, mechanisation and digitalization of the
mining industry, there will still be physical activities
available, for example through maintenance work. Having the
operators alternate between these tasks and control room work
would help vary the otherwise very static workplace.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Practical work:</em> The workplace should include practical and
creative work tasks with handheld machines or tools to break from
working only with computers or control systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>This aspect can also benefit from including maintenance work to
vary the control room work. Furthermore, since the new
technologies will likely require adapting into the already
complex mining systems of today, there will be opportunities for
more creative work through retrofitting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Mental work:</em> Work tasks or problem solving should include
cognitive work in addition to physical work and should be performed
cooperatively with colleagues and management. This should include
workplace learning, development and training.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Control room work in mining industries offer many opportunities
for mental work and brings groups of operators together to the
same workplace.</p></li>
<li><p>A more digitalized organisation would enable easier
communication and cooperation between groups that would
otherwise rarely meet.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Variation:</em> Throughout the day, employees should be provided
opportunities for job rotation, development of work tasks and
flexibility in ways to perform the tasks. This is to prevent
potential ergonomic and mental loads from working with the same
tasks repeatedly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the remote-controlled mining workplaces may allow for
rotating between work tasks, there might be less variation
between tasks as they would all be controlled through computer
systems in control rooms. Including maintenance work tasks could
help introduce more variation in work content and working
environments, making the job less monotonous.</p></li>
<li><p>Variation between work tasks require that the employees are
trained in how to handle the different tasks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Work pace:</em> The work pace should include both intensive and calm
periods in order to engage people while also providing opportunities
for rest and reflection.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the work pace in mining is continuous around the clock,
there are few calm periods outside of assigned breaks.
Introducing autonomous or semi-autonomous machines to the mining
workplace would allow for more opportunities for calmer periods
during the work. As an example, mining vehicles could
autonomously drive to their destination, allowing the operator a
short break from active work. The operator could then take
control during more complicated or critical tasks once the
vehicle has arrived.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Work satisfaction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>A demand for the person:</em> Workplaces where the employees feel like
they are needed and that they perform important work are generally
considered to be more attractive.</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>As the mining industry needs more skilful people and people
from younger generations, those people may become more
interested in the job if that demand can be communicated to
them. Potential ways to communicate the demand could include
having a presence in mining-related educations to show students
that they are in demand.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Existing employees could feel more appreciated if the importance
of their knowledge and skillsets is made more apparent for them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Recognition:</em> The employees should themselves feel that they have
done a good job, in addition to being provided recognition for their
work from management, colleagues or customers. Good performance
should be rewarded according to the employee’s subjective
preference; perhaps through a monetary reward or through more time
off.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Results:</em> The employees need to clearly understand what the results
of their work is and how it contributes to the workplace.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The switch from operating the machines yourself to controlling
them from a remote control room could cause some disconnect to
their work for the employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Working from a control room with more digital systems provides a
good opportunity to visualise and present the operators with an
overview of the entire mine process.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Status:</em> The workplace contributes to and strengthens an employee’s
sense of pride, success and professional identity. Companies must
communicate to their employees the value of their work and their
knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The mining industry has had an image of heavy, tough and dirty
but profitable work for a long time. The change towards more
digital and remote work could impact that image, and in turn
impact people’s perception of the industry.</p></li>
<li><p>As many existing employees have established a sense of pride for
working in the current mining industry, changing the way mines
are operated might negatively affect the attractiveness of the
job for them.</p></li>
<li><p>At the same time, moving towards the implementation of more
modern technologies could make the industry more attractive
towards younger generations of employees.</p></li>
<li><p>A more even gender distribution would help improve the status of
mining work today, especially amongst younger generations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Stimulation:</em> The workplace provides an opportunity for the
employees to put in effort and use their skills in their work. The
work being too difficult can be demoralizing for them, while it
being too easy can lower the employees’ motivation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The mining workplaces of today and of the future both provide
opportunities for stimulating work, however they may be
stimulating in different ways. A current employee may find
future mining workplaces to be unstimulating, while future
employees may find it opposite.</p></li>
<li><p>Regardless of what subjective views employees have of the work,
they need to be provided with proper training and support if the
work is difficult for them.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Even though mining workplaces have the potential to fulfil the
dimensions of attractiveness, it could still be difficult to accommodate
for each of these aspects at once. However, this doesn’t mean that the
workplace cannot be attractive if it only fulfils most or some aspects.
What is important is that the parts of the workplace that negatively
affect attractiveness are being compensated for through other positive
aspects to ensure that the negative impact is lessened. For example, if
heavy and ergonomically unhealthy tasks are unavoidable, supportive
equipment and opportunities for rest in between can be used to lessen
the negative impact. That way, an image of a safe and accessible
workplace can better be conveyed and maintained.</p>
