An important part of gender equality work is a situation assessment from a gender perspective, e.g. a gender analysis, meaning that facts are gathered, and that gender patterns are made visible and analyzed. Gender divided statistics is a necessary tool for gender analysis. Gender divided statistics enfolds not only statistics by sex, the statistics must aim at visualizing men and women’s conditions and needs at work and identifying problem areas. It is important to recognize both similarities and dissimilarities between men and women. A good way to start is to analyze issues of work division, task assignments, competence development, career paths to leadership positions, recruitment processes, sick leave, injuries, harassment cases, etc. – from a gender perspective. To perform an in depth gender analysis, quantitative and qualitative, with the aim of addressing norms, you need competence specializing in this field. If the groundwork is in place according to good knowledge about the organization and women and men’s condition, it is easier to introduce and implement new actions.</a></li>

A common mistake it to just formulate a general objective: increasing the number of women in the organization, gazing at numerical gender equality goals X % in policy documents. A good way to start is for example the SMART-tool. SMART goals is a tool used to formulate goals that are; <em>Specific</em> (clearly defined), <em>Measurable</em> (can be measured and followed up), <em>Accepted</em> (of all actors involved), <em>Realistic and Relevant</em> and <em>Time-limited</em> (a deadline is provided). Aim at identifying objectives in both quantitative and qualitative terms.</a></li>

To achieve the aim of improved gender equality, it is important that in the early stages think about organizational conditions and make plans on how to go about it. A good planning process is important in change management and in all gender equality initiatives as such. The project/initiative/action needs a: 1. Budget, 2. Schedule/timetable, 3. Accountability, who/m is responsible and for what. Allocating of resources (money, time, capacity) is an important steep to formalize the project and to prepare the organization for the upcoming action and change. Do not forget that change management and gender equality initiatives have costs! An important issue in the planning phase is also to determine if there is a need for expertise outside the organization. Do we need specialized competence for example process leaders or gender experts?</a></li>

To ask for results and evaluate the measures implemented is also a way to visualize that gender issues are a priority and important an important issue for the organization. Evaluation must be made of the result/outcome in relation to project specific objectives, preferably both in quantitative- and qualitative terms. But also evaluation of the process as a whole, what can we take with us to the next cycle? At last, the entire process and its content should be carefully documented in order for the work to be implemented as an organizational structure that is easy to follow, evaluate and for the work not to be dependent on specific individuals in the organization.</a></li>

<p>Safety work has evolved over time in the mining industry. During the 1980’s and 1990’s focus was to a significant extent put on technological solutions such as improved protection from hazards related to blasting and safer and more efficient machinery. New laws and regulations have also come into effect in the last decades that have led to more systematized risk management practices overall. Although technological solutions and the implementation of formal rules still play an important part, there has been a trend towards finding more novel organizational solutions for safety-related issues. One such solution is improving the <em>safety culture</em> within the companies.</p>
<p>Safety culture can be defined as the “shared and learned meanings, experience and interpretations of work and safety – expressed partially symbolically – which guide peoples’ actions towards risks, accidents and prevention.” Richter &amp; Koch <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-ref" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. In practice, improving safety culture often involves a focus on encouraging safe behaviors. This includes the introduction of new procedures that are seen as facilitating certain types of behavioral practices. However, safety culture is a complex phenomenon that also involves interactions and exchanges among the workers themselves, i.e. safety culture emerges in a “bottom-up” fashion and may establish worker-specific norms and values that are outside of the direct control of management.</p>
<p>The notion of safety culture being something that both management can improve and something that evolves naturally among the workers themselves is succinctly encapsulated in a model by Edwards et al <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-ref" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span> (figure 9.1).</p>
<p><img src="media/09-understanding-and-improving-safety-culture/media/image1.png" style="width:3.25594in;height:3.53712in" alt="Model of safety culture" />Edwards et al <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-ref" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Safety outcomes can thus be seen as being dependent on three different “types” of culture that interact with each other in complex ways – or rather that three different perspectives can be taken on the nature and characteristics of culture. Normative culture highlights that specific structures, policies and procedures will make certain behavioral practices more likely to occur (i.e. pragmatic culture) that, in themselves, are affected by the beliefs, values and expectations of the workers (i.e. anthropological culture). However, while taking the interconnectedness of the three perspectives into account, it is clear that a dedicated focus by management on implementing appropriate structures, policies and procedures is a promising avenue for cultural change. One reason for this is that the formal structures and processes of an organization are under the direct control of management and, consequently, something that can be fairly easy to change – and that this eventually may have an effect on the meaning workers ascribe to safety. For example, Guldenmund <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-ref" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span> suggests that the safety management system of an organization may play an important part in creating meaningful safety practices for the workers by, e.g., making it clear what is expected of them in their daily work. Still, it is also important to consider how new initiatives will be perceived and interpreted by the workers given that culture, in the anthropological sense described above, can be seen as something “belonging” to the members of the organization themselves. If the suggested changes to policy and procedures are not in line with what the workers expect and need, there may be a resistance to change – or, put differently, a clash between cultures. Of course, some policies and procedures may be non-negotiable, for example wearing personal protective equipment and following safety rules, but it is important to reflect on the actual consequences that management-led initiatives will have from a cultural perspective.</p>
<p>As seen, safety culture is a complex phenomenon and there are no easy solutions or implementation strategies. The literature, however, provides some additional considerations that mining companies can make when seeking to develop their culture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is important to consider cultural issues in relation to other vital aspects of workplace safety, such as the current and future levels of technology development. Mining companies operate in conditions of intricate technical, physical and organizational relationships; everything is connected to each other and it is important to consider both “soft” (e.g. safety culture) and “hard” (e.g. technology development) perspectives on safety Lööw &amp; Nygren <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-ref" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Cultural change may require several years, even decades, to come into effect Guldenmund <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-ref" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>, so management needs to take this into account when developing and implementing new structures and processes aimed at supporting the development of safety culture.</p></li>
<li><p>If a mining company hires contractors, it is important to consider how the workers of these external companies can be integrated into the structures and processes of the mining company – and the level of integration that is appropriate given the formal division of responsibilities between different employers Lööw &amp; Nygren <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-ref" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. A reasonable start could be to synchronize the safety management systems of every company involved with that of the mining company. Cultural integration, in itself, may not be possible or even desirable due to the often short-term projects contractors are hired to perform. However, by introducing the workers to the context for safety work it can become clear what kind of meaning that should be placed on safety and that it is everyone’s responsibility to act accordingly.</p></li>
