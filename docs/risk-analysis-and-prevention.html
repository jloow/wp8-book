An important part of gender equality work is a situation assessment from a gender perspective, e.g. a gender analysis, meaning that facts are gathered, and that gender patterns are made visible and analyzed. Gender divided statistics is a necessary tool for gender analysis. Gender divided statistics enfolds not only statistics by sex, the statistics must aim at visualizing men and women’s conditions and needs at work and identifying problem areas. It is important to recognize both similarities and dissimilarities between men and women. A good way to start is to analyze issues of work division, task assignments, competence development, career paths to leadership positions, recruitment processes, sick leave, injuries, harassment cases, etc. – from a gender perspective. To perform an in depth gender analysis, quantitative and qualitative, with the aim of addressing norms, you need competence specializing in this field. If the groundwork is in place according to good knowledge about the organization and women and men’s condition, it is easier to introduce and implement new actions.</a></li>

A common mistake it to just formulate a general objective: increasing the number of women in the organization, gazing at numerical gender equality goals X % in policy documents. A good way to start is for example the SMART-tool. SMART goals is a tool used to formulate goals that are; <em>Specific</em> (clearly defined), <em>Measurable</em> (can be measured and followed up), <em>Accepted</em> (of all actors involved), <em>Realistic and Relevant</em> and <em>Time-limited</em> (a deadline is provided). Aim at identifying objectives in both quantitative and qualitative terms.</a></li>

To achieve the aim of improved gender equality, it is important that in the early stages think about organizational conditions and make plans on how to go about it. A good planning process is important in change management and in all gender equality initiatives as such. The project/initiative/action needs a: 1. Budget, 2. Schedule/timetable, 3. Accountability, who/m is responsible and for what. Allocating of resources (money, time, capacity) is an important steep to formalize the project and to prepare the organization for the upcoming action and change. Do not forget that change management and gender equality initiatives have costs! An important issue in the planning phase is also to determine if there is a need for expertise outside the organization. Do we need specialized competence for example process leaders or gender experts?</a></li>

To ask for results and evaluate the measures implemented is also a way to visualize that gender issues are a priority and important an important issue for the organization. Evaluation must be made of the result/outcome in relation to project specific objectives, preferably both in quantitative- and qualitative terms. But also evaluation of the process as a whole, what can we take with us to the next cycle? At last, the entire process and its content should be carefully documented in order for the work to be implemented as an organizational structure that is easy to follow, evaluate and for the work not to be dependent on specific individuals in the organization.</a></li>

<p>A heavy responsibility for safe mines lays on the mine planners’ shoulders. They must find solutions that promote high productivity and good economy as well as safety and a healthy work environment. The mine planners will initially shape the general and specific work environment for miners for many years to come. If the planners design a poor solution and it is necessary to redesign it, it will also probably be very expensive to correct after it has been implemented.</p>
<p>Work environment and safety issues are unfortunately often left quite unattended in the early stages of mine planning and design when they instead should be systematically highlighted and developed from the very first planning steps. The best and most efficient way to gain safety is through proactive planning instead of reactive corrective actions. It is also the best way to reduce the associated costs for risk elimination and reduction.</p>
<p>The mine planner is however not alone, he or she works in a company context where safety climate and culture, safety policy and safety management have a strong influence on how well the planner can succeed in his or her work.</p>
<p>The slogan “Safety first” has been heard in the mining business for many decades but is still in many cases no more than a slogan since safety first is not fully practiced, especially if the business has financial problems. It seems however that the times are changing and many mining companies are now making great efforts to improve their safety climate and safety culture. Research on safety has shown that at positive safety climate and well developed safety culture is an important requisite for a healthy and safe work environment, especially in heavy industries.</p>
<p>In order to manage the risks in the business every mining company is also in need of a strategic long-term policy regarding how to deal with safety issues and strive for better work conditions. The safety policy shall direct and establish systematic ways to manage (plan, steer and control) the safety work, also including early planning and design activities.</p>
<p>Because mining is a very risky business it has to follow and obey a lot of directives, laws and provisions. Most of these rules only stipulate minimum demands and the companies are free to exceed them. This is also what mine planners should aim at, exceeding minimum demands. A first step for a mine planner is therefore to get acquainted with the national and international (ie EU regulations) system of rules and basic demands. Many of these demands are provided by the national or EU authorities. This has to be done in a thorough way in each country there are quite a large number of directives, laws and provisions that regulate and give guidelines for health and safety issues in underground mining.</p>
<p>The basis for all activities in systematic health and safety work shall always be an initial thorough risk assessment both of the present state and a future planned state. It is of course easier to assess present or historical risks than future risks, especially if the future holds large changes in technology and or work organization. Still a mine planner needs to assess the risks with different mining concepts that are developed and planned.</p>
<p>Mining might develop in a revolutionary way, but will most probably develop in another way, in an evolutionary way. This means that much can be learned from history and from the present state. Thorough evaluations of present and historic designs have for example systematically been used by the Swedish mining company LKAB in the design of their newest main level at 1365 m below surface. This evaluation has been very important since the time span from the first conceptual designs to the final solutions has stretched over 12 years and a large number of planners.</p>
<p>Risk assessments can be performed in number of ways depending on the situation and circumstances. All risk assessment shall however be based on probability and consequence for unwanted events. A practical tool for this purpose is a risk matrix that eases a systematic and consequent risk assessment, se below.</p>

<p>The classical tools for the identification of occupational risks in the existing production environments are Safety rounds, Incident and Accident reporting. These tools are however less suithe tableto identify and assess risks in future work environments. There you need other types of more proactive methods such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preventive deviation analysis</p></li>
<li><p>Preventive energy analysis</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A deviation is according to Harms-Ringdahl <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-ref" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span> defined as an event or condition that deviates from the intended or normal. The purpose of a deviation analysis is to prevent, to predict abnormalities that can cause damage and to develop proposals to improve safety measures. Deviation Analysis is a very useful method since it takes into account the entire system, Human-Technology-Organization. Energy analysis focuses more on technology and might be useful when developing new productions systems. Three main components considered in an energy analysis are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Energy that can damage</p></li>
<li><p>Targets that may be harmed</p></li>
<li><p>Barriers to Energy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The energies usually considered are: Gravity, height (including static load); Linear motion; Rotary motion; Stored pressure; Electrical energy; Heating and cooling; Fire and explosion; Chemical effects; Radiation; Miscellaneous (human movement, sharp edges, and points).</p>
<p>There are also many other different risk analysis methods that can be used during the development of new production systems. Besides the methods mentioned above methods like Preventive Work Safety Analysis (PWSA), Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Event Tree Analysis (ETA), Work Environment Screening Tool (WEST) etc. are possible to use. The most appropriate tools have to be chosen for every specific analysis task and the users of the tools must also have the necessary competence in order to attain reliable and relevant results. Here the mining business probably can learn much from other industries that have strong safety cultures and long experience of systematic risk management. Especially important will be to learn how to proactively manage risks for fatalities and other severe risks. Here so called leading indicators are preferred instead of lagging indicators.</p>
<p>Even if there are many risk evaluation tools available the mining industry seems to need new and efficient tools <strong>for description, evaluation and design of work environment during early phases of strategic decision making and production system design. The most important decisions regarding work environment and safety are made by top management when mining methods, technology, work organization etc. are decided. Therefore risk analyses regarding these matters should be made as early as possible in the mine design process.</strong></p>
<p>Once a risk analysis is completed it often requires measures which in most situations should be implemented in the following well known order:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Prevent already in the planning stage, replace the hazards entirely. For example, through automation to eliminate manual or mechanized underground work.</p></li>
<li><p>Isolate the individual hazard, risk process. For example, by designing ventilation and layout so that the blasting fumes can’t be spread outside the risk zone.</p></li>
<li><p>Change process technology and behavior. For example, DTH-drilling with water hydraulics rather than pneumatics to reduce dust emissions.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit the hazard through enclosures, physical protection. For example, build concrete borders and railings at the shaft openings.</p></li>
<li><p>Isolate personnel from the hazard risk area. For example, by supplying the mining vehicles with safety cabs with good climate control.</p></li>
<li><p>Risk is reduced by instructions, procedures, training, etc. For example, procedures for safe handling of explosives.</p></li>
<li><p>Risk is reduced through personal protective equipment. For example, functional working clothes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the complexity and severity of problems one may require different combinations of measures as described above. One recommendation is to always try to attack the root causes of the problem first. It tends to result in the most cost efficient and result efficient solutions. This is an important task for mine planners. They have the best opportunity to eliminate a lot of potential health and safety problems when they develop the first conceptual solutions. Planners that don’t realize this and neglect these matters can cause great harm for many years to the mining personnel and their company.</p>
