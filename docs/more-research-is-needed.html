<h1><span class="header-section-number">15</span> More research is needed</h1>
<p>Future efficient mining operations will be dependent upon a highly
competent and well motivated work force, on all levels. The mining
companies will have to recruit their personnel from a limited group of
talented individuals with high demands and expectations on future work.
To cope with the future labour supply, the mining industry must change
the image of mining work and increase the attractiveness of working in
the sector, especially for young women and men.</p>
<p>We know a lot about what creates an attractive job, but we don't know
everything. It is important that the mining industry keeps up with this
quest for knowledge, the world is changing and new knowledge is
required. The winners are the ones who apply the knowledge quickly and
translate it into practice.</p>
<p>Below we describe a number of activities required in order to attract
and keep skilled personnel in the future mining industry. To achieve
this, we have identified six areas that need further clarification
through research:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Digitalization opens up for new opportunities to create attractive
workplaces in a safe environment, and jobs that provide space for
the employee's full expertise and creativity. But there are also
risks that need to be addressed, such as privacy issues, increased
stress and work-life boundaries.</p></li>
<li><p>With the increased digitization, new qualifications are needed.
These must be identified and programmes for reskilling and lifelong
learning must be formed.</p></li>
<li><p>Research on health and safety has been successful, but the industry
still needs innovative methods to control health and safety-related
issues. To be perceived as a safe industry, a zero vision is
required based on better proactive safety work.</p></li>
<li><p>Health and safety conditions for contractors must be explored and
more inclusive safety cultures must be developed.</p></li>
<li><p>Companies must be proactive and try to avoid creating problems in
the first place. This is especially important in mining where
initial mistakes can have consequences for a very long time.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, to develop a holistic concept for the attractive mine that
can attract young people.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Research must work with these issues from different time perspectives.
The long-term vision is the zero-entry mine where all machines are
self-regulated or remote-controlled from operations centres above
ground. These centres are designed to promote co-operation and creative
problem solving in multi-skilled teams of men and women. Basic safety
level is not an issue anymore: dangerous work tasks are performed by
robots.</p>
<p>In a shorter perspective, many workers remain underground. Here, there
are new methods for iterative mine planning that take work environment
and safety into account and reduce common initial design errors when
mines are planned; production is organised through a holistic approach
based on production teams and broad professional skills among management
and miners; mining work has been transformed into being attractive to
both women and men, not only because of the wages, but also because it
is an interesting occupation with good potential for personal and
professional development and lifelong learning in a safe and sound
working environment. Still, a number of issues of attractive workplaces
should be considered in future research and innovation as well; the most
important are addressed below.</p>
<p>First, digitisation and its effects have an obvious place in a future
research agenda. Used correctly, digitalisation can create attractive
jobs that provide space for the employee's full expertise and
creativity. But there are also risks which need to be analysed and
considered. Furthermore, competence development, learning at work etc.
should be prioritized. These topics are vital in order to meet the
demands of new technology and can guarantee flexibility for the company
and development in one’s professional role. Important focus areas for
research are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How can the new roles of the operators (i.e. “Operator 4.0”) meet
the values and expectations that young women and men have when they
enter work life?</p></li>
<li><p>How should digitised production systems address privacy issues?</p></li>
<li><p>How to gain acceptance and avoid resistance for new technology?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a need for new methods for learning at work, something both
employers and employees want. To guarantee development in one’s
professional role and inhibit becoming stuck in the demands of a special
task requires a certain degree of generalness in competence development.
Broad work roles are a classic demand that can also be combined with the
ideas behind Lean mining. The industry has a general need to recruit
more women. Important focus areas for research are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identification of future skills requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Development of new education programmes for reskilling and
competence development of management and workers as part of a
lifelong learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a strategy for recruiting more women.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a mentor system for miners so that professional knowledge is
transferred between generations.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop VR and AR for training and simulation, particularly the
operations in hazardous environments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Health and safety at work must have top priority. Mechanisation, remote
control and automation are efficient preventive safety measures. They
are also appropriate for reducing workload to avoid musculoskeletal
injuries and allow for recovery periods. New technology makes it
possible to both warn of dangerous working conditions and monitor
employees' health conditions in real time. Improved safety is also a
matter of a developed safety climate in the form of relevant education,
rules and effective leadership, with safety prioritised in the
day-to-day-work. In short, there is a need for further development of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How we can increase safety by monitoring the operators in real time?</p></li>
<li><p>New methods for monitoring and controlling the work environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Efficient tools for proactive safety control, as well as broader
analyses of the impact of digitalization on health and safety in
general.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgraded safety climate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the increased number of contractors must be addressed. Focus
should be on the benefits and potential problems that come from a
workforce of in-house personnel and contractors. This includes
strengthening both formal (e.g. implementing joint safety management
practices) and informal (e.g. communication and interaction in the
workplace) relations in multi-employer worksites. Important issues in
this area include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reviews of the health and safety conditions for contractors in
mining</p></li>
<li><p>The development a safety culture that includes contractor.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Many problems in the work environment in present mines (and in other
industry as well) can be traced back to insufficient initial physical
planning and design. Since mining is characterized by huge investments
and long term operations it is very important with a well designed
physical production system. The physical layout also influences and
limits the organizational aspects. If initial mistakes are made the
personnel will have to stand the negative consequences for many years to
come. The initial design phases of every major development project are
therefore critical for establishing a safe and attractive physical and
psycho-social work environment in a mine.</p>
<p>The main idea and research task in this challenge is to combine and
further develop a general iterative industrial planning and design
method <span class="citation">(Ranhagen <a href="#ref-Ranhagen1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span> with available and relevant work environment
tools and combine them with the demands of the new technology. The final
product, that is planning guidelines with focus on work environment
design in underground mines, shall be adapted to the users (pre-study
engineers, feasibility engineers, project planners, automation
engineers, layout planners, ventilation planners etc.) needs and
professional situation. Such guidelines, preferably integrated with
CAD-planning and design tools, would help these professional to create
more safe and attractive future workplaces in the mines.</p>
<p>Designers of mine productions systems also have quite a lot of
legislation and compulsory provisions to regard as well as company
specific rules and standards for the work environment and the management
of health and safety <span class="citation">(Johansson and Johansson <a href="#ref-Johansson2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. These aspects must also be
integrated in the guidelines for work environment planning and design.
The major research task can be described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of alternative guidelines for early and critical stages
of future mine design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, although the traditional image of mining is not particularly
attractive and the industry still has health and safety issues that need
to be considered, we think that it is possible to create a new vision of
future mining - a vision of a high technology industry that speaks to
today's young people. Mining companies must more actively demonstrate
their social responsibility. Employees want to feel proud to work in the
company, which means that issues such as vision, mission and core values
are important. If we manage these problems well, they can be turned into
advantages that create new, attractive job roles. All these factors
affect the company's image, and thus the possibility of recruiting
young talented people to the industry. Overall, broader strategic
research areas should include matters related to</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the development of a holistic concept for the zero entry mine;</p></li>
<li><p>the development of efficient programmes for development of
attractive societies;</p></li>
<li><p>the development of a model for an ethical, ecological and
diverse workplace and recognised as a green branch; and</p></li>
<li><p>give the industry a new image that can attract young people.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The mining industry must be prepared to meet the technological
development on human terms. In a longer perspective, this can lead to
the recognition of the mining industry as an ethical, ecological and
diverse industry that can offer challenging jobs and attractive
workplaces.</p>
