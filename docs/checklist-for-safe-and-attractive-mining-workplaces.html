An important part of gender equality work is a situation assessment from a gender perspective, e.g. a gender analysis, meaning that facts are gathered, and that gender patterns are made visible and analyzed. Gender divided statistics is a necessary tool for gender analysis. Gender divided statistics enfolds not only statistics by sex, the statistics must aim at visualizing men and women’s conditions and needs at work and identifying problem areas. It is important to recognize both similarities and dissimilarities between men and women. A good way to start is to analyze issues of work division, task assignments, competence development, career paths to leadership positions, recruitment processes, sick leave, injuries, harassment cases, etc. – from a gender perspective. To perform an in depth gender analysis, quantitative and qualitative, with the aim of addressing norms, you need competence specializing in this field. If the groundwork is in place according to good knowledge about the organization and women and men’s condition, it is easier to introduce and implement new actions.</a></li>

A common mistake it to just formulate a general objective: increasing the number of women in the organization, gazing at numerical gender equality goals X % in policy documents. A good way to start is for example the SMART-tool. SMART goals is a tool used to formulate goals that are; <em>Specific</em> (clearly defined), <em>Measurable</em> (can be measured and followed up), <em>Accepted</em> (of all actors involved), <em>Realistic and Relevant</em> and <em>Time-limited</em> (a deadline is provided). Aim at identifying objectives in both quantitative and qualitative terms.</a></li>

To achieve the aim of improved gender equality, it is important that in the early stages think about organizational conditions and make plans on how to go about it. A good planning process is important in change management and in all gender equality initiatives as such. The project/initiative/action needs a: 1. Budget, 2. Schedule/timetable, 3. Accountability, who/m is responsible and for what. Allocating of resources (money, time, capacity) is an important steep to formalize the project and to prepare the organization for the upcoming action and change. Do not forget that change management and gender equality initiatives have costs! An important issue in the planning phase is also to determine if there is a need for expertise outside the organization. Do we need specialized competence for example process leaders or gender experts?</a></li>

To ask for results and evaluate the measures implemented is also a way to visualize that gender issues are a priority and important an important issue for the organization. Evaluation must be made of the result/outcome in relation to project specific objectives, preferably both in quantitative- and qualitative terms. But also evaluation of the process as a whole, what can we take with us to the next cycle? At last, the entire process and its content should be carefully documented in order for the work to be implemented as an organizational structure that is easy to follow, evaluate and for the work not to be dependent on specific individuals in the organization.</a></li>

Resistance can also stem from a temporary drop in performance which is very common when employees learn new systems and skills.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">21</span> Checklist for safe and attractive mining workplaces</h1>
<div class="chap-auth">
<p>
While ensuring and creating safe and attractive mining workplaces is important, it’s understandably not a simple task. There are many aspects, issues and questions that must be considered and addressed in order to achieve that goal, enough that it would be very difficult to try and address them all at once. Making wider, simpler analyses on the current state of a mining workplace, however, can still be useful. Identifying what areas of a mining workplace that can be changed to improve safety and attractiveness should be done to allow for early analysis and planning of actions. It’s possible, however, that people become blind to the faults and needs for improvement in their working environment. This checklist aims to help highlight potential areas of improvement in a mining workplace that could make it a safer and more attractive workplace, without presenting in-depth solutions that may limit the decision-making process.
