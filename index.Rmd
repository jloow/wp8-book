# Preface {-}

This book is a product of SIMS (Sustainable Intelligent Mining Systems;
<http://simsmining.eu>. So far it is a work in progress.^[To a certain
extent, it will always be a work in progress; see the later chapters.]
It is a book that intends to give the reader some tools to help them in
the social management of new technology. It is aimed chiefly at the
mining industry; due to its unique characteristics, much traditional
knowledge -- or rather, knowledge regarding these issues from other
industries -- are not readily applicable. Therefore, this book seeks to
adapt much of "uncontextualised" knowledge to the mining industry. To do
so, we use the technologies of SIMS.

## About the project {-}

The vision of SIMS is to create a long lasting impact on the way we test
and demonstrate new technology and solutions for the mining industry.
With a selected consortium ranging from mining companies, equipment and
system suppliers to top-class universities, the SIMS project will boost
development and innovation through joint activities aiming at
creating Sustainable Intelligent Mining Systems.
