<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Future of metal mining</h1>
<p>The world’s metal mining industry is rapidly changing and faces a
number of challenges which must be addressed with a socio-technical
approach that covers the whole mining and minerals value adding chain
including environmental issues. We have tried to capture this uncertain
future in fourteen predictions presented below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Future mining will be shaped in a context where it is necessary to
produce at costs that are determined in <em>international competition</em>.
The prices of metals and minerals are set by the market but in the
long term, there is little doubt that the demand is increasing.
Large nations like China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and the whole of
Africa will require a larger share of consumption which is leading
to the opening of new mines. The difference between these
countries' annual “per capita”-consumption and Western Europe can
be more than 10 times.</p></li>
<li><p>Production conditions will be characterized by the fact that the
nearby and easily accessible ores will be mined first. <em>New ores
will also become more distant or found in the depths</em>. Large ore
reserves are located under the sea and there is hardly any doubt
that the mining and off-shore companies will develop new technology
to extract these. In both cases, production costs will increase.</p></li>
<li><p>Mining depths increase, and it brings new stability problems. The
role of rock mechanics in the design of layouts, cutting sequences,
strata stabilization, roof bolting etc. must be a central issue for
the future. <em>Full face drilling and cutting</em> should be interesting
from a safety perspective, both directly in safer drifting
operations and also in that it can create more stable galleries due
to reduced or no blasting damages. Cutting should also be useful for
selective mining of high quality ore in narrow ore bodies.
Production drilling and blasting for <em>controlled fragmentation</em> are
two very crucial operations in the ore mining cycle. Improvements in
these operations opens up many possibilities for <em>automation</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The environmental requirements</em> affect both energy consumption and
management of ore tailings. The discussion of energy consumption is
largely linked to global warming and carbon emissions. Today not all
nations have joined the Paris Climate Agreement, but in the long
term, some form of coordination surely will be established. The cost
of emission allowances will be a significant factor to consider.</p></li>
<li><p>The mining industry is an <em>energy-intensive industry</em> with high
CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Improvement of energy efficiency will increase the
economic profitability as well as reducing environmental impact.
There are many components that affect the total energy consumption;
one often discussed is underground pre-concentration (in situ). It
affects directly the energy consuming hoisting and milling. The use
of fossil diesel fuel is extensive and causes environmental
burdens. A transition to electric power and battery operation is in
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>The discussion of <em>waste management</em> is about to leave as few
footprints in nature as possible. We must not leave toxic substances
which leak out into nature and the landscape should be restored as
far as possible. One solution discussed is <em>in situ mining</em> where as
much as possible of the production and processing will take place
underground. Such technology is however not without environmental
risks and risks for health and safety. Pollution of mine water is
the single most important environmental issue for the mining sector
and consequently also effective mine water treatment. With regard to
water in general it is a question about <em>closing the loops</em> and
re-using the process water as much as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>The environmental debate also includes a discussion on the mining
industry's <em>social responsibility</em> for the welfare of the local
community. In addition to preserving the environment they are
supposed to build a strong technical and social infrastructure that
ensures survival of society after mining has ceased.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Health and safety</em> are very high on the agenda and are also strong
driving forces behind the ideas of automation. In the future we will
have a production with <em>zero entry</em> for employees underground based
on automation and remote control</p></li>
<li><p>A generally good and safe working environment is seen as a
prerequisite for the recruitment of skilled workers. The typical
underground <em>work environment</em> with noise, dust and toxic fumes and
gasses will be monitored by using advanced sampling strategies with
portable, more accurate and reliable measuring devices and more
efficient counter measures can be taken.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Industrie 4.0</em> is based on implementation of Internet of Things, 5G
and Big data where the entire production process is included in
internet-based networks that transform the mines to smart mines. We
will soon see the outlines for Mining 4.0 where miners equipped with
mini cameras can for everyday and emergency situations provide their
colleagues and senior management with information that is difficult
to convey verbally.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The extended business</em> and <em>open collaboration</em> are two concepts
where VR technology can be used to link production functions such as
planning, mining, maintenance, logistics, purchasing and for
coordination of external contractors, suppliers, customers, etc. all
connected to a production flow, a value adding chain, where all
share the same goal and everyone sees the same whole. Common
visualization of problems and opportunities in the system allows for
all to optimize the whole chain rather than sub-optimizing parts.</p></li>
<li><p><em>New professional roles</em> with a higher proportion of remote control
from production centers and <em>collaborative visualization rooms</em>,
perhaps located in nearby communities, or further away (other
continents), where the operators have monitoring and coordinating
activities across the value chain. Their jobs will change character
towards service work and the new tasks require different kinds of
skills. In addition to deal with advanced information technology the
miners have to interact with different specialist team located all
over the world.</p></li>
<li><p>New technology create a new type of work - new in terms of
<em>competencies and knowledge</em> as well as workload. There is an
emerging, and in many aspects already evident, knowledge
transformation – from the old and obsolete physical and tacit
knowledge and skills (for example the ability to ‘read the rock’) to
something new which can be described as abstract knowledge. This can
challenge the identity of the miners and create a resistance to
change.</p></li>
<li><p>The mines of the future will have a smaller staffing and it is also
clear that they will meet a different kind of <em>model for work
organization</em> than today. Mining companies will gradually turn to a
flat and <em>lean organization</em> with multi-skilled workers who can
operate in several areas and functions within the company. There is
also a discussion about staffing system based on <em>fly-in fly-out</em>
which is more independent of a local community.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are of course other important areas of development, but the above
discussed are expressed as the most important from a long-term strategic
and sustainable view. A major conclusion is that the challenges and the
changes are so large and numerous that a comprehensive international
cooperation is needed both within and outside the industry in order to
succeed. Working separately would lead to a far to slow development,
something that is undesirable for both the companies and the miners.
Another conclusion is that a successful mining industry must work
simultaneously with all the problems mentioned above. There is a need
for a new and modern vision for the whole industry based on a
socio-technical approach that covers the whole mining and minerals value
adding chain including environmental issues.</p>
