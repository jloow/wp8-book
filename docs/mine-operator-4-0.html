<h1><span class="header-section-number">13</span> Mine Operator 4.0</h1>
<p><em>Industrie 4.0</em> is a strategy that was shaped by the German government
in 2013. Industry 4.0 is described as the next great industrial
revolution. After the steam engine, electricity and electronics, the
revolution consists of an implementation of “Internet of Things, Humans
and Services” where the entire production process is included in
internet-based networks that transform ordinary factories to <em>smart</em>
factories <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kagermann2013" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span>. Similar concepts have appeared all over the
world. The Chinese government promotes a similar idea under the name
<em>Made in China 2025</em>, the the Japanese government has launched <em>Society
5.0</em> and the Swedich government use the term <em>Smart Industry</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the German vision paints a bright picture of the future
industry in which virtual and physical worlds will be linked into a
powerful ‘whole’ through the integration of software – from product
development and production, machines will not just do ‘physical work’
but also perform calculations. This is described as cyber-physical
systems, or even socio-cyber-physical systems: smart ventilation, smart
logistics, smart maintenance, smart machines and other smart systems
continuously exchange information with themselves and with human
workers. The German strategy highlights the potential for skill
development and a richer working life with more challenging work tasks.</p>
<p>Industry 4.0 will also come to affect the mining industry. In fact, some
mines have taken important steps towards the digitalized mine of the
future. Gradually, the mining industry gets closer to the visions of
Industry 4.0 and fully automated mines as well as more technologically
sophisticated ore processing facilities. Analogous to the application of
Industry 4.0 in a mining context, we conceptualize Mining 4.0 as a
mining operation where the miner is an expert who ensures that
production runs smoothly. A Mining 4.0 operator is not confined to a
control room. Instead, real-time process data and the status of machines
follow the miner as they move around the mine. The miner solves problems
on the spot by remotely interacting with other operators, experts,
suppliers and customers in multi-competent teams. Production control
could even be done in a digital model (or “digital twin”) far away from
the factory. In short, Mining 4.0 envisions an augmented miner with
senses and memory extended through technology. This technology takes
advantage of and supports human skills and increases situational
awareness through sensors embedded in the clothes of operator, for
example, while keeping an uninterrupted operational vigilance.</p>
<p><span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Romero2016" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span> formed a typology of the future Industry 4.0 operator:
Operator 4.0. It built on eight characteristics that can be seen as the
core of the new technology; we have modified them to relate to the
future miner:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strengthened operator</strong> – Powered industrial exoskeletons assists
with heavy loads and lifts, while also mitigating vibrations. This
helps operators avoid musculoskeletal disorders from unergonomic
work. In future mines, while much of the work will be done remotely,
exoskeletons can be useful during manual work tasks, such as
maintenance work and manual drilling. A common optimistic hope is
that this opens up for women. This technology doesn’t come without
drawbacks, however. Industries could start using exoskeleton
technology to mitigate health problems from work tasks rather than
addressing and solving the issues that cause the problems in the
first place.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Augmented operator</strong> – Augmented reality glasses allows for
overlaying digital information onto the real world. It has many
possible uses in the mining industry that would help provide and
translate information for the operators while out working. This
includes having work instructions show the operators what they need
to interact with and when, navigational aid within mines and
displaying machine information such as fuel levels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Virtual operator</strong> – VR technology provides interactive 3D
visualizations, for example allowing operators to train and interact
with a virtual machine before working with a physical one. In the
mining industry, VR technology could simulate sitting inside the
cabin of a machine through cameras while the operator would in
reality be sitting in a remote control room, allowing for more
accurate remote control. It also allows for training simulations to
become more realistic or engaging. The combination of VR technology
and remote controlled machines could, however, lead to outsourcing
parts of production control to low-wage countries becoming a more
viable and attractive prospect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Healthy operator</strong> – Tracking of operators’ health values and
position to notify them of danger, identify injured people and
locating them. This can help locate people and provide vital
information if an accident, such as a cave-in, were to occur in the
mine. The technology can also be used to better monitor and organise
the operators in the mine. For example, operators can be guided
based on monitoring data to travel through safer paths with less
traffic, which will make navigating the mine safer and more
efficient. At the same time, one must be aware that these systems
are a threat against personal integrity and must be handled with
care. The technology could be used to control workers rather than
the process. In a safety critical situation this type of human
tracking might be welcomed, but the information could also be
misused.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Smarter operator</strong> – Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPA) will,
through voice interaction technology, allow for operator to more
easily interface with machines and digital systems. For example, an
operator would be able to vocally ask the IPA where certain vehicles
are, and the IPA would map out a route. For a mining operator, an
IPA could make it easier to access and managing information while
out working or performing maintenance. They could also be used to
control semi-autonomous machines vocally, for example by asking a
drill to drive to a specific part of the mine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collaborative operator</strong> – Advancements in industrial robot
technology would allow for robots more capable of avoiding collision
with any nearby people or objects. This would allow operators to
work side-by-side with industrial robots and will help make tunnels,
where mining vehicles travel, safer for the employees. The
optimistic perspective for this technology sees that the robots take
over the dangerous, unergonomic and/or tedious work tasks, letting
the employees focus on interesting and safe work tasks. In a
pessimistic perspective, robots and technology take over all jobs,
essentially replacing the people with machines. The fear of this
occurring must be taken into account when implementing the
technology so as to not cause worry and incite resistance from the
employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social operator</strong> – The utilization and implementation of social
networking technology in the organisation would allow for better
communication possibilities between operators and machines. This
also allows for more opportunities for informal knowledge sharing
between operators. With the development and implementation of
5G-networks in mining industries, operators and machines can utilize
high-speed connections to communicate even from below ground. The
greater capabilities to stay connected could, however, lead to a
thinning of the lines between work and spare time due to employees
being more readily available at all times.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analytical operator</strong> – With more data being gathered from
machines and systems, operators can better understand their
performance and status. In addition, the increased amount and types
of information allows for better forecasts of system and machine
performance. This allows for better scheduling of more types of
maintenance work. The increased data flow can also come to affect
the mining operators in that their work tasks could be focused more
on optimization and development.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This classification points to the numerous possibilities of integrating
Industry 4.0 with human labour – some good and some bad. But this
development is not about <em>creating new</em> kinds of jobs. Rather it is a
development that means that most current jobs will be <em>influenced</em> by
these characteristics and developments. Miners will not disappear, but
they will be different in the future.</p>
